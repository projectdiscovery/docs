## What is **Subfinder?**

Subfinder is a subdomain discovery tool that finds and returns valid subdomains for websites. 
Using passive online sources, it has a simple modular architecture optimized for speed. Subfinder is built for one thing - passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.

Subfinder complies with all the passive source licenses and usage restrictions for its sources. The passive model guarantees speed and stealthiness that can be leveraged by both penetration testers and bug bounty hunters alike.

[Check out this post on all of Subfinder's features](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/do-you-really-know-subfinder-an-in-depth-guide-to-all-features-of-subfinder-beginner-to-advanced/) from the ProjectDiscovery Blog for more.
