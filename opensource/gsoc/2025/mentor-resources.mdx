# Mentor Resources & Best Practices

Practical tips, strategies, and resources to help you be an effective GSoC mentor.

## Communication Best Practices

### Frequency & Timing

**Minimum Requirements**:
- 2 check-ins per week
- 24-hour response time for blocking issues
- 48-hour response time for general questions

**Recommended**:
- 3-4 touchpoints per week (mix of sync/async)
- Daily presence in Discord during active hours
- Weekly video/voice call for deeper discussions
- Quick responses to show you're engaged

### Effective Check-ins

**Good Check-in Questions**:
- What did you accomplish since last time?
- What are you working on now?
- Any blockers or challenges?
- What's your plan for the next few days?
- How are you feeling about progress?

**Structure for Weekly Meetings**:
1. **Progress review** (10 min): What got done
2. **Blockers discussion** (10 min): Current challenges
3. **Code review** (15 min): Review recent PRs
4. **Planning** (10 min): Next week's goals
5. **Questions** (5 min): Open discussion

### Communication Channels

**Discord** - Daily, informal:
- Quick questions
- Progress updates
- Casual conversations
- Community engagement

**GitHub** - Code-related:
- Pull request reviews
- Technical discussions
- Issue tracking

**Video/Voice** - Weekly:
- Deeper technical discussions
- Complex problem-solving
- Building rapport

**Email** - Rare:
- Formal communications
- Privacy-sensitive topics

## Student Management

### Setting Clear Expectations

**First Week Checklist**:
- [ ] Define "done" for each milestone
- [ ] Agree on code quality standards
- [ ] Establish testing requirements
- [ ] Set documentation expectations
- [ ] Clarify communication norms
- [ ] Define success criteria

**Document Your Agreement**:
Create a shared document covering:
- Weekly goals and milestones
- Check-in schedule
- Code review process
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Emergency procedures

### Creating Actionable Milestones

**Bad Milestone**:
- "Work on feature X"
- "Improve performance"
- "Fix bugs"

**Good Milestone**:
- "Implement feature X with unit tests achieving 80% coverage"
- "Optimize function Y to reduce execution time by 30%, measured by benchmark suite"
- "Fix issues #123, #456, #789 with regression tests"

**SMART Milestones**:
- **Specific**: Clear what needs to be done
- **Measurable**: Can verify completion
- **Achievable**: Realistic scope
- **Relevant**: Contributes to project goals
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline

### Providing Constructive Feedback

**Feedback Framework**:

1. **Acknowledge effort**: Recognize what they did well
2. **Identify issue**: Specific problem, not general criticism
3. **Explain why**: Context for why it matters
4. **Suggest solution**: Concrete improvement steps
5. **Offer resources**: Links, examples, documentation

**Example**:
```
❌ "This code is inefficient"

✅ "Great work implementing the feature! I noticed the nested loops
here create O(n²) complexity. For large datasets, this could slow
things down significantly. Consider using a hashmap for O(n) lookup
instead. Here's an example from our codebase: [link].

Also, the PR description is very clear - nice job explaining your
approach!"
```

### Recognizing Warning Signs Early

**Red Flags**:
- 🚩 No commits for 3+ days without explanation
- 🚩 Consistently missing self-set deadlines
- 🚩 Not responding to messages for 24+ hours
- 🚩 Code quality declining
- 🚩 Avoiding difficult parts of project
- 🚩 Making excuses instead of asking for help
- 🚩 Defensive about feedback

**What to Do**:
1. **Reach out proactively**: "Haven't heard from you, is everything okay?"
2. **Have a direct conversation**: Express concerns clearly
3. **Identify root cause**: Technical blocker? Personal issue? Motivation?
4. **Create action plan**: Specific steps to get back on track
5. **Set checkpoints**: More frequent check-ins temporarily
6. **Escalate if needed**: Involve org admins if no improvement

## Technical Guidance

### Code Review Strategies

**What to Focus On**:

**Priority 1** - Must fix:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes
- Test failures
- Critical bugs

**Priority 2** - Should fix:
- Code style violations
- Missing tests
- Unclear variable names
- Missing documentation

**Priority 3** - Nice to have:
- Minor optimizations
- Formatting nitpicks
- Subjective style preferences

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Does code solve the problem?
- [ ] Are there tests with good coverage?
- [ ] Is code readable and maintainable?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Is documentation updated?
- [ ] Does it follow project conventions?
- [ ] Are there security concerns?
- [ ] Is performance acceptable?

### Balancing Guidance vs. Independence

**When to Guide More**:
- Early in the project
- Learning new concepts
- Complex architectural decisions
- Security-critical code
- Stuck for > 24 hours

**When to Let Them Struggle**:
- Straightforward implementations
- Similar to past work
- Good learning opportunities
- Stuck for < 8 hours
- Would figure it out with time

**Signs You're Too Hands-Off**:
- Contributor stuck for days
- Making same mistakes repeatedly
- Quality declining
- Losing motivation

**Signs You're Too Hands-On**:
- Telling them exactly what to code
- Solving problems for them
- Not giving time to think
- Micromanaging implementation details

### Teaching Moments

Transform code review into learning:

**Instead of**: "Change line 45 to X"
**Try**: "What do you think would happen if we used X here instead? Consider edge case Y."

**Instead of**: "This is the wrong approach"
**Try**: "This works, but there's a tradeoff. Approach A is simpler but slower. Approach B is faster but more complex. For our use case, which do you think fits better and why?"

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Contributor Becomes Unresponsive

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Delayed responses (24+ hours)
- Vague progress updates
- Decreasing commit frequency

**Action Plan**:
1. **Day 1**: Send friendly check-in via Discord
2. **Day 2**: Follow up via email
3. **Day 3**: Mark as urgent, CC org admins
4. **Day 4-7**: Daily check-ins, document attempts
5. **Day 7+**: Escalate to org admins, discuss evaluation

**Prevention**:
- Build rapport early
- Make yourself approachable
- Notice early signs of disengagement
- Regular, positive interactions

### Challenge: Project Scope Too Ambitious

**Signs**:
- Consistently behind timeline
- Milestones taking 2x estimated time
- Contributor feeling overwhelmed
- Quality declining due to rush

**Solutions**:
1. **Assess realistically**: How much can be done?
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly**: What's essential vs. nice-to-have?
3. **Rescope project**: Cut features, not quality
4. **Adjust timeline**: Rebalance milestones
5. **Document changes**: Update proposal and timeline
6. **Reset expectations**: Communicate new goals

**Prevention**:
- Review timeline carefully during community bonding
- Build in 20-30% buffer time
- Start with MVP, add features incrementally

### Challenge: Code Quality Issues Despite Feedback

**Patterns to Notice**:
- Same issues in every PR
- Not addressing review comments
- Tests added but don't actually test
- Documentation is placeholder text

**Approach**:
1. **Understand why**: Lack of skill? Time pressure? Confusion?
2. **Be more explicit**: Show examples of what "good" looks like
3. **Pair program**: Work through one example together
4. **Set standards**: "This PR can't merge until tests pass and coverage is >75%"
5. **Escalate if needed**: If no improvement, discuss with org admins

**Resources to Share**:
- Project style guide
- Example PRs from the codebase
- Testing best practices docs
- Pair programming sessions

### Challenge: Technical Blockers

**Types of Blockers**:
- **Knowledge gap**: Doesn't know how to approach problem
- **Tool/environment issues**: Setup problems
- **Dependency on others**: Waiting for external factors
- **Complexity**: Problem harder than expected

**Resolution Strategies**:

**For knowledge gaps**:
- Share relevant documentation
- Point to similar code in codebase
- Explain concepts with examples
- Pair program if needed

**For tool issues**:
- Help debug setup
- Provide working examples
- Consider alternative tools
- Screen share to troubleshoot

**For dependencies**:
- Identify workarounds
- Help remove blockers
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Work on parallel tasks

**For complexity**:
- Break into smaller pieces
- Simplify approach
- Adjust scope if necessary
- Provide more guidance

## Evaluation Guidelines

### Midterm Evaluation

**Pass Indicators**:
✅ 40-50% of project completed
✅ Regular communication maintained

❌ Unresponsive for extended periods
❌ Poor quality despite repeated feedback
❌ No evidence of independent work

### Final Evaluation

**Pass Indicators**:
