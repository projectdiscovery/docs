# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about participating in Google Summer of Code with ProjectDiscovery.

## Eligibility Questions

### Who can apply to GSoC?

Anyone who is at least 18 years old and meets GSoC's eligibility criteria can apply. You should be:
- A student or recent graduate, or
- An open source beginner (first-time contributor)

You must also be able to work legally during the program period.

### Do I need to be currently enrolled as a student?

No, recent graduates and open source beginners can also participate. Check the [official GSoC eligibility rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules) for details.

### Are there age restrictions?

Yes, you must be at least 18 years old to participate in GSoC.

### Can I participate from any country?

Most countries are eligible. However, some countries may be restricted due to legal requirements. Check the [GSoC eligibility page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules) for the current list.

### I'm not a security expert. Can I still apply?

Absolutely! We're looking for strong programmers who are interested in learning about security. GSoC is a learning experience.

## Application Questions

### When should I start my application?

Start engaging with the community 6-8 weeks before the application deadline (April 1, 2025). This gives you time to:
- Understand our tools and codebase
- Make meaningful contributions
- Discuss your ideas with mentors
- Write a strong proposal

<Tip>
Contributors who start early and make contributions before applying have significantly higher acceptance rates.
</Tip>

### Can I submit multiple proposals?

You can submit multiple proposals to different projects within ProjectDiscovery, but we recommend focusing on one strong proposal. Quality is more important than quantity.

You can only participate in **one** GSoC project across **all** organizations, even if multiple proposals are accepted.

### Can I submit proposals to multiple organizations?

Yes, but you can only accept one project if multiple are offered. We recommend focusing on 1-2 organizations where you're most interested and engaged.

### Can I propose my own project idea?

Yes! Custom proposals are welcome, but you should:
1. Discuss your idea with mentors on Discord first
2. Ensure it aligns with ProjectDiscovery's goals
3. Scope it appropriately for 175 or 350 hours
4. Show that you understand our codebase

### Do I need prior contributions to apply?

While not strictly required, contributors with meaningful prior contributions have **much higher** acceptance rates. We strongly encourage making at least 1-3 contributions before applying to demonstrate:
- Your commitment to the project
- Your ability to work with our codebase
- Your communication skills

### What programming languages should I know?

**Required**: Go programming language (most of our tools are written in Go)

**Helpful** (depending on project):
- JavaScript/TypeScript (for web-related projects)
- Python (for tooling and scripts)
- Bash/Shell scripting
- Basic web technologies (HTML, CSS)

You don't need to be an expert in Go, but you should be comfortable reading and writing Go code.

### What if I'm new to Go?

That's okay! If you're experienced in another language (Python, Java, C++, etc.), you can learn Go during the application period. We recommend:
1. Complete the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/)
2. Read [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
3. Try fixing simple issues in our codebase
4. Ask questions in Discord

### How detailed should my proposal be?

Very detailed! Your proposal should include:
- Clear problem definition
- Specific technical approach
- Week-by-week timeline with milestones
- Deliverables for each phase
- Testing and documentation plans
- Your qualifications and past work

See our [proposal template](/opensource/gsoc/resources/proposal-template) and [evaluation criteria](/opensource/gsoc/resources/evaluation-criteria).

## Project Questions

### How many hours per week do I need to commit?

It depends on your project size:

- **175-hour projects**: 12-15 hours per week over 12-14 weeks
- **350-hour projects**: 25-30 hours per week over 12-14 weeks

You should be honest about your availability in your proposal.

### Can I work on multiple GSoC projects?

No, you can only participate in one GSoC project per year, even across different organizations.

### What if I can't complete my project on time?

Communication is key! If you encounter blockers:
1. Notify your mentor immediately
2. Discuss adjusting the scope or timeline
3. Work together to find solutions

Passing is based on making reasonable progress and good communication, not perfection.

### Can I continue working after GSoC ends?

Yes! We encourage all contributors to continue working on their projects and other ProjectDiscovery tools. Many GSoC contributors become long-term maintainers and even future mentors.

### Will my code be merged into the main repository?

Yes, that's the goal! Your work will be reviewed and merged according to our standard code review process. This ensures quality and helps you learn best practices.

## Communication Questions

### How do I contact mentors?

**Primary channel**: Discord #gsoc channel
- Best for questions, discussions, and community engagement

## Evaluation Questions

### How am I evaluated?

You're evaluated at two points:

**Midterm** (July 7-14):
- Have you made meaningful progress (40-50% complete)?
- Is your code quality good?
- Are you communicating well?
- Are you on track with your timeline?

**Final** (September 1-8):
- Did you complete core deliverables?
- Is code well-tested and documented?
- Is work production-ready?
- Did you communicate throughout?

See our [evaluation criteria](/opensource/gsoc/resources/evaluation-criteria) for details.

### What happens if I fail the midterm evaluation?

If you fail midterm, your participation in GSoC ends. However, you can:
- Continue contributing as a community member
- Complete your project independently
- Apply again next year

Failures are rare if you communicate regularly with mentors and make consistent progress.

### What are the evaluation criteria?

Proposals are scored on:
- Technical Merit (30%)
- Implementation Plan (25%)
- Community Engagement (20%)
- Applicant Qualifications (15%)
- Proposal Quality (10%)

[View detailed criteria →](/opensource/gsoc/resources/evaluation-criteria)

### How is success measured?

Success is measured by:
- **Completion**: Did you deliver core features?
- **Quality**: Is code well-tested and maintainable?
- **Communication**: Did you stay in touch and responsive?
- **Documentation**: Is your work well-documented?
- **Learning**: Did you grow as a developer?

Perfection isn't required - consistent progress and good communication are key.

## Program Logistics

### What's the stipend amount?

Stipend amounts are set by Google and vary by project size:
- 175-hour projects: ~$1,500 USD
- 350-hour projects: ~$3,000 USD

Exact amounts are announced by Google each year. Check the [official GSoC site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for current stipends.

### When and how do I get paid?

Google handles all payments directly. You'll be paid in installments:
- After midterm evaluation (50%)
- After final evaluation (50%)

You must pass each evaluation to receive that payment.

### Do I need to pay taxes on the stipend?

Tax requirements vary by country. Google provides documentation, but you're responsible for understanding and meeting your local tax obligations. Consult a tax professional if needed.

### Can I participate if I have other commitments?

Yes, but be realistic about your available time. Common scenarios:

- **Part-time job**: Possible if combined hours don't exceed 40/week
- **Summer classes**: Possible if light course load
- **Internship**: Generally not recommended - GSoC should be your primary summer focus
- **Vacation**: Plan for this in your proposal and inform mentors

Be honest about your availability in your proposal.

### Can I work on GSoC from anywhere?

Yes! GSoC is fully remote. Work from wherever you're comfortable. Just ensure you're in an eligible country and can meet the time commitments.
