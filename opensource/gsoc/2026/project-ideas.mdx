  **Size**: 350 hours
  **Mentors**: To be assigned
  **Reference**: [Issue #5838](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/issues/5838)
</Card>

#### Description

Build an intelligent XSS context analyzer for Nuclei that detects injection contexts and generates context-aware payloads. Instead of blindly throwing XSS payloads, this system will analyze where user input appears in the response and craft appropriate payloads for that specific context.

Current XSS testing often relies on large payload lists that may not work in specific contexts. This analyzer will identify whether input lands in HTML content, JavaScript, attributes, URLs, or CSS, then suggest or generate payloads optimized for that context.

  - Context-specific payload selection
  - Encoding-aware payload generation
  - Filter bypass suggestions
  - Payload mutation for WAF evasion

  - `xss_context()` - detect injection context
  - `xss_payload()` - generate appropriate payload
  - `xss_encode()` - context-aware encoding
  - Filter detection and bypass helpers

  - Reflection point identification
  - Character filtering detection
  - Encoding transformation analysis
  - Confidence scoring for contexts

- **Built-in Templates**: Context-aware XSS detection templates
- **Documentation**: Context analysis guide and examples

#### Technical Skills Required
