# Mentor Guidelines

Guidelines and responsibilities for mentors participating in ProjectDiscovery's Google Summer of Code program.

## Mentor Role & Responsibilities

### Time Commitment

**Expected**: 5-6 hours per week during coding period

**Breakdown**:
- 1-2 hours: Check-ins and meetings with contributor
- 2-3 hours: Code review and technical guidance
- 1 hour: Communication, planning, documentation
- 1 hour: Coordination with other mentors/admins

### Core Responsibilities

1. **Guide the contributor** through their project
2. **Review code** regularly and provide constructive feedback
3. **Communicate** at least twice weekly with contributor
4. **Track progress** against project timeline
5. **Evaluate** at midterm and final checkpoints
6. **Escalate issues** to organization admins when needed
7. **Document** important decisions and changes

## Pre-Program Phase

### Proposal Review (April)

**Tasks**:
- Review all proposals for your project area
- Score proposals using evaluation criteria
- Provide feedback on technical approaches
- Participate in selection discussions
- Help rank top candidates

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Technical merit and feasibility
- Contributor's understanding of the problem
- Realistic timeline and planning
- Prior community engagement
- Communication quality

### Contributor Selection (Late April - Early May)

**Tasks**:
- Review top-ranked proposals in detail
- Check contributor's prior contributions
- Verify technical capabilities
- Confirm availability and commitment
- Make final selection recommendations

<Warning>
**Important**: Once selections are made, mentors are committed to supporting their contributor(s) for the entire program duration.
</Warning>

## Community Bonding Period (May 1-26)

### Goals for This Phase

Help your contributor prepare for success:

1. **Build relationship**: Get to know each other
2. **Finalize plan**: Create detailed week-by-week schedule
3. **Setup environment**: Ensure dev environment is ready
4. **Set expectations**: Clarify communication norms
5. **Review code**: Familiarize with relevant codebase areas

### Initial Meeting Agenda

Cover these topics in your first meeting:

- **Introductions**: Background, experience, interests
- **Project review**: Confirm understanding of goals
- **Timeline refinement**: Adjust milestones if needed
- **Communication plan**: When and how to check in
- **Tools setup**: Development environment, access
- **Questions**: Address any concerns

### Communication Norms to Establish

Agree on:
- **Check-in schedule**: Days and times for regular meetings
- **Communication channels**: Discord, email, video calls
- **Response time expectations**: How quickly to respond
- **Progress updates**: How often and in what format
- **Blocker escalation**: How to handle issues

## Coding Period (May 27 - Aug 31)

### Weekly Routine

**Minimum twice per week**:
- Technical check-ins (synchronous or async)
- Code reviews
- Progress tracking
- Blocker identification

**Recommended structure**:
- **Monday**: Week planning, milestone review
- **Wednesday/Thursday**: Mid-week check-in, code review
- **Friday**: Week wrap-up, next week preview

### Code Review Best Practices

**What to Review**:
- Code quality and style
- Test coverage
- Documentation
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Integration with existing code

**How to Provide Feedback**:
✅ Be constructive and educational
✅ Explain "why", not just "what"
✅ Suggest improvements with examples
✅ Acknowledge good work
✅ Be timely (review within 24-48 hours)

❌ Don't be overly critical or harsh
❌ Don't just point out problems without guidance
❌ Don't let PRs sit for days without feedback

**Example Feedback**:
```
❌ "This code is bad, rewrite it."

✅ "This approach works, but we can improve efficiency.
Currently O(n²) due to nested loops. Consider using
a hashmap for O(n) lookup. Here's an example: [code]

Also great job on the comprehensive test coverage!"
```

### Tracking Progress

**Weekly**:
- Review commits and PRs
- Check milestone completion
- Update project tracker
- Identify any delays or blockers

**Indicators of Good Progress**:
✅ Regular commits (3-5+ per week)
✅ Milestones completed on time
✅ Responsive to feedback
✅ Proactive communication
✅ Quality code with tests

**Warning Signs**:
⚠️ No commits for 3+ days
⚠️ Not responding to messages
⚠️ Missing milestones
⚠️ Rushed code without tests
⚠️ Avoiding difficult parts

### Handling Blockers

**When contributor gets stuck**:

1. **Understand the problem**: Ask questions to clarify
2. **Guide don't solve**: Help them find the solution
3. **Provide resources**: Documentation, examples, references
4. **Pair if needed**: Screen share to work through issues
5. **Adjust if necessary**: Rescope if blocker is major

**Escalate to admins if**:
- Contributor becomes unresponsive (3+ days)
- Technical blocker requires org-level decision
- Scope needs significant adjustment
- Personal issues affecting participation

## Evaluation Periods

### Midterm Evaluation (July 7-14)

**What to Assess**:
- Progress: 40-50% of project completed?
- Code quality: Well-tested and documented?
- Communication: Regular and responsive?
- Trajectory: On track to complete?

**Pass Criteria**:
✅ Completed core milestones for first half
✅ Code quality meets standards
✅ Communicates regularly
✅ Demonstrates problem-solving ability
✅ Responsive to feedback

**Fail Criteria**:
❌ < 30% progress with no clear path forward
❌ Unresponsive to communication (7+ days)
❌ Poor code quality despite feedback
❌ Hasn't made meaningful contributions
❌ Unable to work independently

<Warning>
**Before failing**: Discuss with org admins. Failing ends the contributor's participation.
</Warning>

### Final Evaluation (Sept 1-8)

**What to Assess**:
- Completion: Core deliverables finished?
- Quality: Production-ready code?
- Documentation: Comprehensive and clear?
- Tests: Good coverage and passing?
- Overall: Successful project?

**Pass Criteria**:
✅ All core deliverables completed
✅ Code merged or mergeable
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ Good test coverage (70-80%+)
✅ Positive collaboration throughout

**Evaluation Form**:
Google provides a form covering:
- Work product quality
- Communication
- Evaluation recommendation (pass/fail)
- Narrative feedback

## Best Practices

### Communication

**Be available**:
- Respond within 24 hours
- Set up regular check-ins
- Be present in Discord
- Make yourself reachable

**Be proactive**:
- Check in even if contributor doesn't
- Ask about progress regularly
- Notice warning signs early
- Celebrate wins and milestones

### Technical Guidance

**Teach, don't just tell**:
- Explain reasoning behind suggestions
- Share resources for learning
- Encourage exploration
- Guide problem-solving process

**Balance support and independence**:
- Let them struggle a bit (learning opportunity)
- Step in when truly stuck
- Encourage asking for help
- Build confidence through success

### Motivation

**Keep contributors engaged**:
- Recognize achievements
- Provide positive reinforcement
- Show real-world impact of their work
- Connect them with the community

**Address issues early**:
- Notice declining engagement
- Check in on blockers
- Adjust expectations if needed
- Provide encouragement

## When to Escalate

Contact organization admins if:

- ⚠️ Contributor unresponsive for 3+ days
- ⚠️ Major scope changes needed
- ⚠️ Technical decisions requiring org input
- ⚠️ Considering failing an evaluation
- ⚠️ Interpersonal conflicts
- ⚠️ You're unable to fulfill mentor duties
