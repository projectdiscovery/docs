Email is for private communications only. Prefer public channels (Discord/GitHub) when possible.

## Communication Etiquette

### Asking Good Questions

<Tip>
**Before asking**, search Discord history and GitHub issues to see if your question has been answered before.
</Tip>

**Good Question Format**:
1. **Context**: What are you trying to do?
2. **What you've tried**: Steps you've already taken
3. **Specific problem**: Exact error or issue
4. **Environment**: Relevant details (OS, version, etc.)

**Example**:
```
❌ Bad: "httpx doesn't work, help!"

✅ Good: "I'm trying to use httpx to scan a list of URLs from a file,
but I'm getting a 'connection refused' error. I've tried:
1. Running with -v flag
2. Checking the target is accessible with curl (works fine)
3. Testing with a single URL (works)

Error message: [paste error]
Command: httpx -l urls.txt
OS: Ubuntu 22.04, httpx version: v1.3.0

Any ideas what might be wrong?"
```

### Response Time Expectations

**From you**:
- **Within 24 hours** for mentor questions
- **Same day** for critical blocking issues
- **Regular updates** on Discord during GSoC

**From mentors/community**:
- **24-48 hours** during application period
- **24 hours** for GSoC blocking issues
- **48 hours** for general questions
- Faster responses during UTC business hours

### Professional Communication

✅ **Do**:
- Be respectful and professional
- Provide context and details
- Thank people for their help
- Share solutions when you figure things out
- Help others when you can
- Be patient and understanding

❌ **Don't**:
- Send unsolicited DMs to mentors (use public channels)
- Ask the same question across multiple channels
- Demand immediate responses
- Share confidential or inappropriate content
- Spam or flood channels
- Be dismissive of feedback

## Making Your First Contribution

### Finding Good Issues

Look for issues labeled:
- `good-first-issue`: Perfect for newcomers
- `help-wanted`: Community contributions welcome
- `documentation`: Improve docs
- `bug`: Fix a reported problem

**Where to Find Them**:
```
https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/labels/good-first-issue
https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/labels/help-wanted
```

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Find an issue** you want to work on
2. **Comment** on the issue: "I'd like to work on this"
3. **Fork** the repository to your account
4. **Clone** your fork locally
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nuclei.git
   cd nuclei
   ```
5. **Create a branch** for your changes
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-issue-123
   ```
6. **Make your changes** with tests
7. **Commit** with a clear message
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: description of what you fixed (#123)"
   ```
8. **Push** to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin fix-issue-123
   ```
9. **Create Pull Request** on GitHub
10. **Respond to feedback** and iterate

### Pull Request Best Practices

**Good PR Description**:
```markdown
## Description
Fixes #123 - Brief description of the issue

## Changes
- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

## Testing
- [ ] Added unit tests
- [ ] Tested manually with: [command]
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Screenshots (if applicable)
[Add screenshots for UI changes]
```

**Before Submitting**:
- ✅ Code follows project style guidelines
- ✅ All tests pass (`go test ./...`)
- ✅ Added tests for new functionality
- ✅ Updated documentation if needed
- ✅ Commit messages are clear
- ✅ PR description explains changes

### Responding to Code Review

Code review is a learning opportunity:

1. **Be receptive**: Feedback helps you improve
2. **Ask questions**: If you don't understand, ask for clarification
3. **Explain reasoning**: Share why you made certain choices
4. **Make changes**: Update your PR based on feedback
5. **Thank reviewers**: Appreciate their time

<Tip>
Don't take feedback personally. Even experienced developers get lots of comments on their PRs!
</Tip>
