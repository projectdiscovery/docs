</Tip>

## Proposal Structure

Your proposal should include these sections:

### 1. Personal Information
- Full name and contact details
- GitHub and Discord usernames
- University and graduation year (if applicable)
- Time zone and location
- Expected availability

### 2. Abstract (2-3 sentences)
Concise summary of your project:
- What problem you're solving
- Your approach
- Expected outcome

**Example**: *"This project will implement a performance profiling framework for Nuclei templates to identify bottlenecks and optimize scan speed. The solution includes profiling hooks in the template engine, a CLI analysis tool, and a web dashboard for visualization. The expected outcome is 20-30% improvement in template execution speed for complex scans."*

### 3. Project Description

#### Problem Statement
- What problem are you solving?

- Alternative approaches considered
- Expected benefits

#### Technical Approach
- Specific implementation details
- Technologies and libraries you'll use
- Architecture and design patterns

### 4. Implementation Plan

Break your project into phases with specific milestones:

- Detailed weekly milestones
- **Deliverables**: [What will be completed]

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Weeks 9-12)**

<Tip>
Each milestone should be specific and measurable. Instead of "Implement feature X", write "Implement feature X with unit tests achieving 80% coverage".
</Tip>

### 5. Testing Strategy

✅ "Implement three specific features: rate limiting (Week 3-4), custom headers support (Week 5-6), and response caching (Week 7-8)"

### Show Your Work
- Link to your prior contributions
- Include code samples or demos
- Reference specific files/functions in the codebase
- Show you've done your research

### Be Realistic
- Don't over-promise
- Account for learning curve

- Have someone else review it

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
Avoid these pitfalls that hurt proposals:
</Warning>

### Too Vague
❌ Generic descriptions without specifics
❌ "Will improve the tool"
❌ No technical details
✅ Specific features, approaches, and outcomes

### Too Ambitious
❌ Proposing to rewrite major components
❌ 500+ hours of work in 350-hour project
❌ No buffer for problems
✅ Realistic scope with buffer time

### No Prior Engagement
❌ First interaction is submitting proposal
❌ No contributions to ProjectDiscovery
❌ Hasn't tried the tools
✅ Active community member with contributions

### Copy-Paste
❌ Generic proposal that could apply anywhere
❌ Copied from other proposals
❌ No customization to ProjectDiscovery
✅ Specific to ProjectDiscovery and the project

### Poor Planning
❌ Vague milestones like "Work on feature X"
❌ All work in first few weeks
❌ No testing or documentation time
✅ Detailed weekly plan with testing included
