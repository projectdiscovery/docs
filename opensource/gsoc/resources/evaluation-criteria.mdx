# Proposal Evaluation Criteria

Understanding how proposals are evaluated helps you craft a competitive application. At ProjectDiscovery, we look for contributors who demonstrate technical skill, community engagement, and realistic planning.

## Overview

All proposals are reviewed by project mentors and organization administrators using a consistent evaluation rubric. The selection process is competitive, and we aim to choose contributors who will successfully complete their projects and continue contributing to the community.

### Scoring System

Proposals are scored across five categories, each weighted differently based on importance:

| Category | Weight | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Technical Merit | 30% | Quality of the technical approach |
| Implementation Plan | 25% | Realism and detail of the timeline |
| Community Engagement | 20% | Prior contributions and involvement |
| Applicant Qualifications | 15% | Relevant skills and experience |
| Proposal Quality | 10% | Clarity and professionalism |

## Evaluation Categories

### 1. Technical Merit (30%)

This evaluates the soundness and quality of your technical approach.

**What We Look For**:

- Appropriate choice of technologies and methods

<Tip>
**Strong proposals** demonstrate deep understanding of the existing codebase and provide specific technical details about implementation approach.
</Tip>

**Excellent** (27-30 points):
