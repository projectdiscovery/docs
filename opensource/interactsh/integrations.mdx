## ZAP Add-On

Interactsh can be used with OWASP ZAP via the [OAST add-on for ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/oast-support/). With ZAP's scripting capabilities, you can create powerful out-of-band scan rules that leverage Interactsh's features. A standalone script template has been provided as an example (it is added automatically when you install the add-on).

- Install the OAST add-on from the [ZAP Marketplace](https://www.zaproxy.org/addons/).
- Go to Tools &rarr; Options &rarr; OAST and select **Interactsh**.
- Configure [the options](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/oast-support/services/interactsh/options/) for the client and click on "New Payload" to generate a new payload.
- OOB interactions will appear in the [OAST Tab](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/oast-support/tab/) and you can click on any of them to view the full request and response.
- You can set Interactsh as the default for ActiveScan in the `Options` > `OAST` > `General` menu.
- When checking the `Use Permanent Database` option, you can review interactions that occurred after ZAP was terminated.
- See the [OAST add-on documentation](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/oast-support/) for more info.
