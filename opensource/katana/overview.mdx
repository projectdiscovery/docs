## What is **Katana?**

Katana is a command-line interface (CLI) web crawling tool written in Golang, designed to be fast, efficient, and provide simple output. 
It is designed to crawl websites to gather information and endpoints. One of its defining features is the ability to use headless browsing to crawl applications. 
This means that it can crawl single-page applications (SPAs) built using technologies such as JavaScript, Angular, or React to effectively access and gather information from these types of applications.
