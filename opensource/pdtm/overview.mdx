ProjectDiscovery Tool Manager or PDTM is an easy way to download and keep your ProjectDiscovery tools organized and easy to access, update, and more. For users interestd in taking advantage of multiple ProjectDiscovery tools we recommend downloading PDTM rather than downloading the binary for each tool separately. 

Check out [the great blog](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/getting-started-with-projectdiscovery-in-linux-and-windows/) for getting started with ProjectDiscovery tools using Linux and Windows. 

You can access the PDTM [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/pdtm).
