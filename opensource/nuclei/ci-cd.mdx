## Why run Nuclei in CI/CD?

Adding Nuclei to CI/CD helps catch regressions earlier and keeps security checks close to code changes.

Common patterns:

- Scan staging endpoints on every push.
- Run template-based regression checks for known issues.
- Export SARIF and publish findings in GitHub Code Scanning.

## GitHub Actions with `nuclei-action`

Use [projectdiscovery/nuclei-action](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-action) to install and run Nuclei directly in a workflow.

### Minimal scan example

```yaml
name: nuclei-scan

on:
  push: {}
  pull_request: {}

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Nuclei
        uses: projectdiscovery/nuclei-action@v3
        with:
          args: -u https://example.com
```

### Install only + run manually

```yaml
name: nuclei-install-only

on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Nuclei
        uses: projectdiscovery/nuclei-action@v3
        with:
          version: latest
          install-only: true

      - name: Verify install
        run: nuclei -version
```

### Use config file from repository

```yaml
name: nuclei-config-scan

on:
  push: {}

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Nuclei with config
        uses: projectdiscovery/nuclei-action@v3
        with:
          config-path: .github/nuclei/nuclei.yaml
```

## Upload SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning

Nuclei can export SARIF and upload it to GitHub Code Scanning.

```yaml
name: nuclei-sarif

on:
  push: {}
  pull_request: {}

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Nuclei and export SARIF
        uses: projectdiscovery/nuclei-action@v3
        with:
          config: |
            target:
              - https://example.com
            sarif-export: results.sarif

      - name: Upload SARIF
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        if: success()
        with:
          sarif_file: results.sarif
          category: nuclei-results
```

## Inputs and precedence

* `args` passes CLI flags directly to Nuclei.
* `config` passes inline Nuclei config.
* `config-path` points to a config file in the repository.
* Do not set `config` and `config-path` together.
* If `args` is set, it takes precedence over `config` and `config-path`.

## Best practices

* Pin `nuclei-action` to `@v3`.
* Store sensitive values in GitHub Secrets.
* Keep custom templates/config in the repository for reproducibility.
* Use SARIF upload when your team relies on GitHub-native triage.
