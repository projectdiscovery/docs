For all of the flags and options available for `cloudlist` be sure to check out the [Usage](/opensource/cloudlist/usage) page. On this page you can find some examples with output, details of what 'cloudlist' supports, and details on configuration.

<Note> If you have questions, reach out to us through [Help](/help). </Note>

## Basic Examples

```
cloudlist
```

This will list all the assets from configured providers in the configuration file. Specific providers and asset type can also be specified using `provider` and `id` filter.

```console
cloudlist -provider aws,gcp

## GCP Asset API Examples

List all assets from a specific GCP organization using the Asset API:

```bash
cloudlist -provider gcp -id organization
```

List assets from specific GCP projects only:

```bash
cloudlist -provider gcp -id organization -json | jq '.[] | select(.provider == "gcp")'
```

## Running cloudlist with Nuclei

Scanning assets from various cloud providers with nuclei for security assessments:- 

```bash
cloudlist -silent | httpx -silent | nuclei -t cves/
```

# Supported providers
For a full list of supported cloud providers, see [Cloud Providers](/opensource/cloudlist/providers).

# Cloudlist as a library

It's possible to use the library directly in your go programs. The following code snippets outline how to list assets from all or given cloud provider.

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "log"

  "github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/pkg/inventory"
  "github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/pkg/schema"
)

func main() {
  inventory, err := inventory.New(schema.Options{
    schema.OptionBlock{"provider": "digitalocean", "digitalocean_token": "ec405badb974fd3d891c9223245f9ab5871c127fce9e632c8dc421edd46d7242"},
  })
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("%s\n", err)
  }

  for _, provider := range inventory.Providers {
    resources, err := provider.Resources(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("%s\n", err)
    }
    for _, resource := range resources.Items {
      _ = resource // Do something with the resource
    }
  }
}
```
