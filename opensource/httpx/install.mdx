## Installation Notes
  - httpx requires the latest version of [**Go**](https://go.dev/doc/install)
  - Add the Go bin path to the system paths. On OSX or Linux, in your terminal use
  
  ```
  echo export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin >> $HOME/.bashrc
  source $HOME/.bashrc
  ```
  - To add the Go bin path in Windows, [click this link for instructions.](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
  - The binary will be located in `$home/go/bin/httpx`
