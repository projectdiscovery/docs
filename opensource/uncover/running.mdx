### Shodan-InternetDB API

**uncover** supports [shodan-internetdb](https://internetdb.shodan.io) API to pull available ports for given IP/CIDR input.

`shodan-idb` used as **default** engine when **IP/CIDR** is provided as input, otherwise `shodan` search engine is used.

```console
echo 51.83.59.99/24 | uncover

  __  ______  _________ _   _____  _____
 / / / / __ \/ ___/ __ \ | / / _ \/ ___/

### [Awesome Search Queries Integration](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/awesome-search-queries)

The `-asq, -awesome-search-queries` flag allows you to use predefined awesome search queries to discover exposed assets on the internet. This feature leverages a curated list of queries that are known to yield interesting results. To use this feature, simply specify the `-asq` flag followed by the desired query. For example, to search for exposed Jira instances, you can use:

```console
uncover -asq jira -silent

....
```


### Field Format

`-f, -field` flag can be used to indicate which fields to return, currently, `ip`, `port`, and `host` are supported and can be used to return desired fields.

```console
uncover -q jira -f host -silent

ec2-44-198-22-253.compute-1.amazonaws.com
ec2-18-246-31-139.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
tasks.devrtb.com
leased-line-91-149-128-229.telecom.by
74.242.203.213.static.inetbone.net
ec2-52-211-7-108.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
ec2-54-187-161-180.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
185-2-52-226.static.nucleus.be
ec2-34-241-80-255.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

### Field Formatting

**uncover** has a `-f, -field` flag that can be used to customize the output format. For example, in the case of `uncover -f https://ip:port/version`, ip:port will be replaced with results in the output while keeping the format defined, It can also be used to specify a known scheme/path/file in order to prepare the output so that it can be immediately passed as input to other tools in the pipeline.


```console
echo kubernetes | uncover -f https://ip:port/version -silent

https://35.222.229.38:443/version
https://52.11.181.228:443/version
https://35.239.255.1:443/version
https://34.71.48.11:443/version
https://130.211.54.173:443/version
https://54.184.250.232:443/version
```

Output of **uncover** can be further piped to other projects in workflow accepting **stdin** as input, for example:


- `uncover -q example -f ip | naabu` - Runs [naabu](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu) for port scanning on the found host.
- `uncover -q title:GitLab | httpx` - Runs [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) for web server probing the found result.
- `uncover -q 51.83.59.99/24 | httpx` - Runs [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu) on host/ports obtained from shodan-internetdb.


```console
uncover -q http.title:GitLab -silent | httpx -silent

https://15.185.150.109
https://139.162.137.16
https://164.68.115.243
https://135.125.215.186
https://163.172.59.119
http://15.236.10.197
https://129.206.117.248
```

- `uncover -q 'org:"Example  Inc."' | httpx | nuclei` - Runs [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) / [nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) for vulnerability assessment.
