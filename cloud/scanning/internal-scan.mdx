Internal network security is critical yet often overlooked. Once attackers gain initial access through configuration drift, phishing, or compromised credentials, they can rapidly expand their foothold by exploiting internal vulnerabilities. This lateral movement can lead to devastating breaches, making internal vulnerability scanning as crucial as external assessments.

ProjectDiscovery offers two distinct approaches for internal network vulnerability scanning, each designed to fit different organizational needs while maintaining our core focus on exploitability and accurate detection.

<Note>
Internal scanning helps identify misconfigurations, unpatched systems, and security gaps that could be exploited for lateral movement before attackers can leverage them.

## Port Discovery with Naabu

Before running vulnerability scans, it's recommended to first identify open ports in your internal network using [Naabu](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu) - a fast and reliable port scanner. This ensures comprehensive vulnerability scanning coverage.

```bash
# Scan entire internal subnet and save results
naabu -host 192.168.1.1/24 -o internal_ports.txt

# Scan specific port ranges
naabu -host 192.168.1.1/24 -p 80,443,8000-9000 -o internal_ports.txt

# Faster scanning with increased rate
naabu -host 192.168.1.1/24 -rate 1000 -o internal_ports.txt
```

<Note>
The discovered ports can be used as input for vulnerability scanning to ensure thorough coverage of all exposed services. Learn more about Naabu's capabilities in our [detailed documentation](/tools/naabu/overview).
</Note>

<Info>
Naabu will soon be integrated directly into ProjectDiscovery's internal vulnerability scanning capabilities. Contact our [sales team](https://projectdiscovery.io/request-demo) to be notified when this feature becomes available.

## Method 1: Local Scanning & Upload

This approach lets you run Nuclei locally and upload results to ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (ProjectDiscovery).

### Set up your API Key

To connect your existing Nuclei results to PDCP you will need to create a free API Key:

1. Visit https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io 
2. Open the setting menu from the top right and select "API Key" to create your API Key
<img class="block" src="/images/pdcp-api-key.png" alt="PDCP API Key" />
3. Use the `nuclei -auth` command, and enter your API key when prompted.

### Configure Team (Optional)

If you want to upload the scan results to a team workspace instead of your personal workspace, you can configure the Team ID using either method:

- **Obtain Team ID:**
  - Navigate to [https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/settings/team](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/settings/team)
  - Copy the Team ID from the top right section
  <img class="block" src="/images/platform/obtain-team-id.png" alt="Obtain Team ID" />

- **CLI Option:**
  ```bash
  nuclei -tid XXXXXX -cloud-upload
  ```

- **ENV Variable:**
  ```bash
  export PDCP_TEAM_ID=XXXXX
  ```

2. Run your scan with the upload flag:
```bash
# Single target
nuclei -u http://internal-target -cloud-upload

# Multiple targets
nuclei -l internal-hosts.txt -cloud-upload

# With specific templates
nuclei -u http://internal-target -t misconfiguration/ -cloud-upload
```

<Note>
This method is ideal when you want to maintain complete control over scan execution or integrate with existing automation scripts.
</Note>

## Method 2: Cloud-Managed Scanning (Recommended)

[TunnelX](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/tunnelx) is our open-source tunneling solution, purpose-built by ProjectDiscovery to enable secure internal scanning. It establishes isolated SOCKS5 proxies that let you trigger scans directly from the ProjectDiscovery interface while ensuring your internal infrastructure remains protected and unexposed.

<Note>
Cloud-managed internal scanning with TunnelX is an Enterprise-exclusive feature. Free and Pro users can still perform internal scans using the local scanning method described above.
</Note>

<Note>
**System Requirements**  
TunnelX is designed to be lightweight and efficient. Minimum recommended specifications for optimal performance:
- **CPU:** 1 vCPU/Core
- **Memory:** 2GB RAM
- **Network:** 100Mbps network interface
- **Storage:** 10GB available disk space
- **Operating System:** Linux (recommended), macOS, or Windows

These specifications are suitable for most deployment scenarios. A basic VPS (Virtual Private Server) meeting these requirements is sufficient for running TunnelX efficiently.
</Note>

### Install TunnelX

Choose your preferred installation method:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Docker (Recommended)
# Pull and run the official image
docker run --network host -d \
  -e PDCP_API_KEY="your_api_key" \
  projectdiscovery/tunnelx:latest

# Or build locally
docker build -t tunnelx https://github.com/projectdiscovery/tunnelx.git
docker run --network host -d -e PDCP_API_KEY="your_api_key" tunnelx
```

```bash Go Installation
# Install using go install
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/tunnelx@latest

# Set your API key and run
export PDCP_API_KEY="your_api_key"
tunnelx
```

```bash Source
# Clone and run from source
git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/tunnelx.git
cd tunnelx
export PDCP_API_KEY="your_api_key"
go run .
```
