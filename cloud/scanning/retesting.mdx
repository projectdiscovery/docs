title: "Retesting Vulnerabilities"
description: "Quickly verify the current status of vulnerabilities through targeted retesting"
---

Retesting allows you to quickly verify the current status of a vulnerability, confirming whether it has been remediated or remains active. This feature is designed for ad-hoc validation of findings, eliminating the need to run full scans repeatedly.

When you initiate a retest, you'll be presented with a confirmation dialog:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/platform/retest-dialog.png" alt="Retest vulnerability dialog showing proxy selection options" />
</Frame>

The retest scan will automatically verify if the vulnerability has been resolved. If fixed, the report status will automatically update to "Fixed". Otherwise, it will revert to its original status.

## Supported Scenarios

### External Vulnerabilities
- Direct retesting of vulnerabilities on externally accessible assets
- No additional configuration required
- Immediate validation of remediation status

### Internal Vulnerabilities
The platform supports retesting of internal vulnerabilities in two scenarios:

1. **Cloud Platform Internal Scans**
   - Results from scans executed through the cloud platform
   - Requires selection of an internal proxy for retesting
   - Maintains consistent access to internal targets

2. **Uploaded Local Scan Results**
   - Support for results from locally executed scans
   - Requires proxy host with access to the original internal targets
   - Seamless integration with existing internal scanning workflows

<Note>
To set up internal scanning capabilities and configure proxies, refer to our [Internal Network Scanning](/cloud/scanning/internal-scan) guide. This covers both TunnelX setup for cloud-managed scanning and local scanning configurations.
</Note>

<Info>
For internal vulnerabilities, you'll need a properly configured proxy. You can either:
- Use TunnelX for cloud-managed scanning (recommended for Enterprise users)
- Set up local scanning with result uploads
Learn more in our [Internal Scanning guide](/cloud/scanning/internal-scan).
