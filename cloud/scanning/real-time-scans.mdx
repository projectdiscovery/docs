Real-time scanning keeps your infrastructure protected against emerging threats by instantly scanning your assets when new security vulnerabilities are discovered. Our community-powered nuclei templates repository acts as a central hub for the latest security findings – from zero-days and 1-day exploits to newly disclosed CVEs being actively exploited in the wild.

Security researchers and engineers worldwide contribute templates as soon as new vulnerabilities trend on the internet, often within hours of disclosure. When these templates are merged into our repository, your assets are automatically scanned without waiting for scheduled runs. This rapid response is crucial for protecting against active exploitation campaigns, especially during the critical window between vulnerability disclosure and patch availability.

Think of it as a security-focused CI pipeline – continuously monitoring, automatically triggering, and instantly protecting your infrastructure against emerging threats.
