- Okta Workforce
- Custom SAML Providers

SAML SSO setup requires manual configuration and verification by the ProjectDiscovery team to ensure secure implementation. Here's what to expect:

1. **Initial Setup Request**
   - After purchasing a Pro plan with SSO add-on or Enterprise contract
   - The ProjectDiscovery team will reach out to begin the configuration process
   - You'll be assigned a dedicated technical contact for the setup

2. **Configuration Steps**
   - Provide your IdP metadata and certificates
   - Configure allowed domains and user attributes
   - Set up SAML assertion mapping
   - Test the integration in a staging environment

3. **Verification & Go-Live**
   - Validate user provisioning and authentication
   - Confirm security settings and access controls
   - Enable the integration for production use
