ProjectDiscovery's Enterprise scanning infrastructure operates from a dedicated set of static IP addresses, enabling organizations to implement precise security controls and whitelisting policies. These fixed IP ranges are exclusively assigned to your organization's scanning activities, providing consistent and identifiable sources for all security assessments conducted through the platform. This dedicated IP infrastructure ensures that your security teams can easily distinguish ProjectDiscovery's legitimate scanning traffic from potential unauthorized scanning attempts.

When configuring your security infrastructure to accommodate ProjectDiscovery scans, you can whitelist these specific IP addresses in your firewalls, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). This whitelisting approach allows you to maintain strict security controls while ensuring uninterrupted vulnerability scanning operations. The platform provides both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, supporting organizations with diverse network configurations and compliance requirements.

Enterprise customers can customize scanning behavior on a per-IP basis, including the ability to set specific rate limits, configure custom headers, or assign particular IPs to different types of scans. This granular control helps organizations optimize their scanning operations while maintaining compliance with internal security policies. For instance, you might assign certain IPs for external asset discovery while reserving others for intensive vulnerability scanning, ensuring proper resource allocation and traffic management.

The platform includes monitoring and analytics for scan traffic from these IPs, providing visibility into scanning patterns, bandwidth usage, and potential scanning issues. This monitoring helps security teams optimize their scanning strategies and troubleshoot any connectivity or performance problems. Additionally, if any of your security systems flag scanning activity from these IPs, you can quickly verify the legitimacy of the traffic against your assigned IP ranges.

For organizations operating in regulated environments or with strict security requirements, our dedicated IP infrastructure provides the necessary isolation and control. Each scanning IP is documented and can be included in security compliance documentation, making it easier to demonstrate proper security controls during audits. The platform also supports custom DNS resolution and proxy configurations when needed for specialized scanning scenarios.
