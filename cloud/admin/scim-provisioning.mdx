## Overview

This guide will help you set up automated user provisioning for your account using SCIM 2.0 (System for Cross-domain Identity Management). Once configured, you'll be able to manage your team's access to ProjectDiscovery's platform directly from your Identity Provider.

<Note>
  SCIM Provisioning is available exclusively for Enterprise customers. Contact our [sales team](https://projectdiscovery.io/request-demo) to enable SCIM for your organization.
</Note>

## Benefits of SCIM Integration

- **Centralized Management**: Manage ProjectDiscovery's platform access directly from your Identity Provider
- **Automated Onboarding**: Automatically add new team members to the platform when assigned in your IdP
- **Instant Offboarding**: Remove access immediately when users leave your organization
- **Consistent Security**: Apply the same access policies across all your applications

## What You'll Need

- Administrative access to your Identity Provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- SCIM credentials from your ProjectDiscovery representative:
    - Base URL
    - Authorization token

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Your Identity Provider

1. Log in to your Identity Provider's admin console
2. Navigate to your ProjectDiscovery application settings
3. Enable SCIM provisioning
4. Enter the credentials provided by your ProjectDiscovery representative:
    - SCIM Base URL
    - Authorization Token
5. Test the connection to verify the integration

### Step 2: Map Users and Roles

When assigning users to ProjectDiscovery's platform in your IdP, you'll need to specify their roles:

- `ADMIN` - Full administrative access to the workspace
- `MEMBER` - Standard access for team collaboration (default)
- `VIEWER` - Read-only access to workspace resources

<Note>
If no role is specified, users will be assigned the MEMBER role by default.
</Note>

### Step 3: Provision Your Team

1. In your IdP console, assign users or groups to ProjectDiscovery application
2. Select the appropriate role for each user
3. On completion, users will be automatically created in your ProjectDiscovery account

## Managing Users

### Adding New Users

To add new users to your ProjectDiscovery account:

1. Assign them to the ProjectDiscovery application in your IdP and enter their role
2. They'll be automatically provisioned in ProjectDiscovery's platform

### Removing Users

To revoke access:

1. Unassign the user(s) from the ProjectDiscovery application in your IdP
2. They'll be automatically removed from your ProjectDiscovery account

### Updating User Roles

To change users' permissions:

1. Update their role assignment in your IdP
2. The changes will be synced automatically to ProjectDiscovery's platform

## SCIM + Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

If your organization uses SSO, SCIM works seamlessly alongside it:

- Users authenticate through your Identity Provider
- SCIM automatically provisions their account if they're assigned in your IdP
- Users are granted access with their assigned role
- No additional ProjectDiscovery credentials are needed

## Migrating Existing Users

If your team is already using ProjectDiscovery and you're adding SCIM:

1. After SCIM is activated, assign/reassign all existing users to the ProjectDiscovery application in your IdP
2. Make sure to specify the correct role for each user during assignment
3. This one-time synchronization brings all users under IdP management
4. Future user management will be handled exclusively through your IdP

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
Please keep the following in mind when using SCIM provisioning:

- **Workspace Owner:** The OWNER role cannot be managed through SCIM. Please contact ProjectDiscovery's support team for any ownership changes.
- **Centralized Control:** Once SCIM is activated, all user management operations must be done through your IdP. Manual user management in ProjectDiscovery's platform will be disabled.
- **Domain Restriction:** Only users with email addresses matching your organization's domain can be provisioned.
</Warning>
