ProjectDiscovery's Audit Logs provide comprehensive visibility into all user activities and system events within your organization's ProjectDiscovery Cloud environment. The audit logging system captures detailed information about every significant action, including user logins, asset modifications, scan initiations, configuration changes, and API access events. Each log entry contains essential metadata such as the timestamp, user identity, IP address, action type, and affected resources, enabling security teams to maintain complete accountability and traceability.

The audit logging interface presents events in a chronological timeline, with advanced filtering capabilities that allow you to search and analyze specific types of activities. Security administrators can filter logs based on multiple parameters including time ranges, user identities, action types, and affected resources. This granular filtering helps during security investigations, compliance audits, or when tracking specific changes across your organization's security workflows.

From a security operations perspective, the audit logs serve as a crucial tool for detecting unusual patterns or potentially unauthorized activities. For instance, you can identify unusual scan patterns, track template modifications, or monitor API key usage across your organization. The system retains audit logs for an extended period, ensuring you have historical data available for compliance requirements or security investigations.

Integration capabilities allow you to export audit logs to your existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems through our API. This enables you to incorporate ProjectDiscovery activity data into your broader security monitoring and alerting workflows. The audit log data can be particularly valuable during incident response scenarios, providing a clear timeline of events and actions leading up to or following a security event.

For organizations with compliance requirements, our audit logs help demonstrate adherence to various security frameworks and regulations. The comprehensive logging of user actions, access patterns, and system changes provides the necessary documentation for security audits and compliance reviews. Each log entry is immutable and cryptographically signed, ensuring the integrity of your audit trail.
