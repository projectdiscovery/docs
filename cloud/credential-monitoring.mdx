<Note>
**Beta**: Credential Monitoring is currently in beta. We're continuously expanding monitoring methods and adding new features to enhance your security posture.
</Note>

Compromised credentials are one of the weakest security points and the easiest attack vector for cybercriminals. ProjectDiscovery's **Credential Monitoring** is a continuous threat intelligence system that detects compromised credentials from dark web sources and infostealer logs, enabling security teams to prevent account takeovers. 

By continuously scanning millions of exposed credentials, the platform identifies actual credential exposures that pose immediate risk to your organization, employees, and customers. We currently focus on dark web leaks and malware logs as these have proven to be the most impactful security vulnerabilities. As we evolve this beta product, we'll be expanding monitoring across GitHub repositories, crawled web pages, and other sources to detect exposed tokens, API keys, and environment secrets.

## Common questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I monitor my company's domain?**
A: Business domain users must verify their domain via DNS TXT record to access organization-wide breach data. Without verification, you'll only see personal email exposures. Enterprise users can verify and monitor multiple domains.

**Q: Why can't I see employee passwords?**
A: Business Domain Users can view employee passwords data after DNS verification. Only Enterprise customers can monitor multiple domains. Customer passwords are never displayed to any user tier to protect customer privacy.

**Q: How current is the data?**
A: We continuously monitor sources 24/7. New breaches typically appear within hours to days of being discovered.

**Q: How do I view my personal leaked credentials?**
A: You can automatically view all leaked credentials associated with the email address you used to sign up. Simply navigate to "My Leaks" to see any exposures linked to your personal email account - no additional verification required.

### Access Control

**Q: Who can view credential monitoring data?**
A: Only users with **Owner** or **Admin** account types can access credential monitoring features. Regular team members cannot view exposed credentials unless granted appropriate permissions.

**Q: Can all team members see our organization's exposed credentials?**
A: No, credential visibility is restricted to Owner and Admin accounts only. This ensures sensitive breach data is only accessible to authorized personnel responsible for security.

### Privacy & Security

**Q: Are you monitoring our employees?**
A: No, we monitor internet-wide credential leaks and aggregate them into a comprehensive database. When you verify your domain, we filter this existing database to show only exposures related to your organization. We're not actively monitoring your employees - we're helping you discover credentials that are already publicly exposed across the internet.

**Q: What should we do when we find a breach?**
A: Verify if account is active, force password reset, enable MFA, check for password reuse, and notify the affected user.

### Technical Details

**Q: How accurate is the breach data?**
A: We aggregate data from multiple verified sources. While false positives are possible, always verify before taking action.

**Q: Can this integrate with our security tools?**
A: API access is available for Enterprise customers to integrate with existing security workflows. See our [Domain Leaks API documentation](/api-reference/leaks/get-domain-leaks) for implementation details.
