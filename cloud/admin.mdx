## Settings

[Profile settings](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/settings) are available from the global navigation under your sign-in (top right) for access to your Profile, Team, Scan IPs and more. 

## Profile

Profile displays your username, email address, and the option to delete your account. 

_Note: The ability to update these profile components will be available in a future release._

## Team

Under **Settings → Team** all users can view team settings. Users with the appropriate permissions can also modify team settings and manage team members. 

View or update team names, manage team members, and delete teams (supported for team owners)

 - Use **Create Team** to create a new team (up to 2 for Pro Tier). 
 - Modify team settings by selecting a team from the global navigation. 

To modify team settings select a team from the global navigation to display those team settings. 

### User Types

ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform supports four types of users with the following permissions:

- Owner: Read, write, invite, billing
- Admin: Read, write, invite
- Member: Read, write
- Viewer: Read

### Managing Teams
Teams can be created by Pro and Custom tier users. A Pro subscription supports up to two teams with 10 members. For a larger quantity of teams, or a greater number of members get in touch about a Custom tier configuration.

### Scan Tokens & Teams
Each organization with a ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform account can only have one owner, and any scan tokens associated with that one owner, regardless of team, will be deducted from the same subscription._ 

 For example, your organization - Acme Enterprises -  has a custom subscription with 10,000 monthly scan tokens and you have three teams: Team A, Team B, Team C. _ 

 - _If Team A runs 500 scans, Team B runs 500 scans, and Team C runs 1000 scans, all 2000 scan tokens will be deducted from the 10,000 total that are available to Acme Enterprises._

## Scan IPs 
Add Static IPs for greater control over your infrastructure scanning.

## Billing 
Purchase, view, or modify your subscription. A subscription to our Pro tier starts at $100/month for 2000 monthly scan tokens. 

Additional upgrade options are also available with higher monthly token limits - reach out to us with any questions about a custom contract. 

## Security (Account Security)
Use Security to update your password or to enable 2-factor authentication.

 - **Password** creates an account password that provides a login with your email (username) and password, as an alternative to using a linked account for login. These credentials will not replace any existing login configurations (for example:GitHub)

 - **Two-step authentication** provides additional authentication for your account with an authenticator application.
