## Pricing

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How many assets can I monitor on the Pro plan?">
Our Pro plan enables users to scan up to 1,000 unique assets per month. If you need higher scanning capacity for your workflows, please contact us at [sales@projectdiscovery.io](mailto:sales@projectdiscovery.io).

A unique asset is a combination of host (subdomain or IP) and port. Once scanned, you can rescan any asset again without extra cost for the rest of the month.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I reach my limit on the Pro plan?">
Once you reach your limit, you will not be able to scan additional unique assets until your limits reset at the start of the next billing month.

You will be notified prior to running a scan if your scan exceeds the remaining count of unique assets in your billing month. You will have the option of proceeding with that scan and we will scan as many new unique assets as possible up to your limit.

You can also reconfigure your scan with fewer assets by applying filters to an asset group and clicking on “Start Vulnerability Scan” or deleting assets from an asset group by scrolling to the right and clicking on the kebab menu and “Delete”.

If you need higher scanning capacity for your workflows, please contact us at [sales@projectdiscovery.io](mailto:sales@projectdiscovery.io).
