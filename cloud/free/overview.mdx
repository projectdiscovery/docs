## Overview

ProductDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) is a hosted enterprise product for continuous visibility and vulnerability scanning. PDCP is currently offered [in two pricing tiers](https://projectdiscovery.io/pricing), Free and Teams. 

The Free version is a great way for existing ProjectDiscovery users, familiar with our open source solutions, to connect their Nuclei scans with PDCP 

If you're new to ProjectDiscovery the Free tier is also a great way to get started with ​PDCP. 

**PDCP Free includes:**
 - Support to connect Nuclei to PDCP and view findings (_up to 1K per month_) 
 - Rescanning in PDCP
 - Sharing findings (vulnerabilities) from PDCP
 - [Template Editor](/editor/introduction) functionality and access to our AI Template Generator (_up to 50 per month_) 

## What do I need to get started with PDCP Free?

To get started with PDCP Free you'll need two things:

- Scan results from Nuclei
- a PDCP Login/Setup

If you already have Nuclei scan results, or you've walked through our [Getting Started example](/getstarted-overview) using Nuclei, you're most of the way there. 

## What's in this User Guide?

In this documentation we're going to walk through:

 - Installing Nuclei as a new user
 - Setting up a new PDCP account
 - Generating an API key and authenticating your account
 - Connecting your Nuclei scan results to PDCP
 - Viewing scan results and exploring features

<Note> If you already have Nuclei scan results skip to the [Connect a Scan](/free/scan) page. </Note>
