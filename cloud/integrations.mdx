## Cloud Asset Discovery

ProjectDiscovery supports integrations with all popular cloud providers to automatically sync externally facing hosts for vulnerability scanning. This comprehensive approach ensures all your cloud resources with external exposure are continuously monitored, complementing our external discovery capabilities. The result is complete visibility of your attack surface across cloud environments through a simple web interface.

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)

<Card title="Configure AWS Integration" icon="aws" color="#FF9900" href="https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/assets/configure?provider=aws">

</Card>

ProjectDiscovery's AWS integration allows the platform to automatically discover and monitor cloud assets across your AWS accounts. By connecting AWS to ProjectDiscovery, security teams and DevOps engineers gain continuous visibility into EC2 instances, S3 buckets, DNS records, and other resources without manual inventory. This integration leverages ProjectDiscovery's open-source **Cloudlist** engine to enumerate assets via AWS APIs. In short, it helps ensure no cloud asset goes unnoticed, enabling proactive security monitoring and easier management of your attack surface.

By covering these services, ProjectDiscovery can map out a broad range of AWS assets in your account. (Support for additional services may be added over time.)

**AWS Integration Methods**

ProjectDiscovery supports three methods to connect to AWS, each suited for different use cases and security preferences:

1. **Single AWS Account (Access Key & Secret)** – Direct credential-based authentication using an IAM User's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to connect one AWS account. Choose this for quick setups or single-account monitoring.
2. **Multiple AWS Accounts (Assume Role)** – Use one set of credentials to assume roles in multiple accounts. This method is ideal for organizations with multiple AWS accounts (e.g. dev, prod, etc.). You provide one account's credentials and the common role name that exists in all target accounts.
3. **Cross-Account Role (Role ARN)** – Use a dedicated IAM role with an External ID for third-party access. This option lets you create a cross-account IAM role in your AWS account and grant ProjectDiscovery access via that role's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This is the most secure integration method, as it follows AWS best practices for third-party account access.

**Prerequisites**

Before configuring the integration, make sure you have:

- **AWS Account** – Access to an AWS account where you can create IAM identities
- **Admin Access to IAM** – Permissions to create IAM users and roles
- **ProjectDiscovery Account** – Access to ProjectDiscovery's Cloud platform
- **Basic AWS IAM Knowledge** – Understanding of IAM users, access keys, and roles

#### 1. Single AWS Account (Access Key & Secret)

To connect a single AWS account directly:

1. **Create a Read-Only IAM User:** In the AWS IAM console, create a new IAM user for ProjectDiscovery integration. Assign **programmatic access** (which generates an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
2. **Attach Required Policies:** Grant the user read-only permissions to the AWS services you want to monitor. You can use AWS-managed policies like **AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess**, **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**, etc. for each service (see the **Required Permissions** section below).
3. **Configure in ProjectDiscovery:**
   - Select **Single AWS Account (Access Key & Secret)**
   - Enter your **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key**
   - Optionally provide a **Session Token** (only for temporary credentials)
   - Give the integration a unique name
   - Select the AWS services you want to monitor

_Tip:_ Use an IAM user with minimal read-only permissions and rotate keys periodically for security.

#### 2. Multiple AWS Accounts (Assume Role)

For monitoring multiple AWS accounts from a central account:

1. **Choose a Primary Account:** Create an IAM user in one AWS account (the "primary") with programmatic access.
2. **Create an IAM Role in Each Target Account:** In each AWS account you want to monitor, create a role that:
   - Uses the **same role name** across all accounts (e.g., "ProjectDiscoveryReadOnlyRole")
   - Has a trust relationship allowing your primary account to assume it
   - Has the required read-only permissions
3. **Configure in ProjectDiscovery:**
   - Select **Multiple AWS Accounts (Assume Role)**
   - Enter the primary account's **AWS Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
   - Specify the **Role Name to Assume** (the common role name)
   - List all **AWS Account IDs** to monitor (one per line)
   - Give the integration a unique name
   - Select the AWS services you want to monitor

#### 3. Cross-Account Role (Role ARN)

The most secure method using ProjectDiscovery's service account:

1. **Create an IAM Role in Your AWS Account:**
   - In your AWS console, go to IAM → Roles → Create Role
   - Select "Another AWS account" as the trusted entity
   - Enter ProjectDiscovery's ARN: `arn:aws:iam::034362060511:user/projectdiscovery`
   - Enable "Require External ID" and enter the External ID shown in the ProjectDiscovery UI
   - Attach the necessary read-only permissions
2. **Configure in ProjectDiscovery:**
   - Select **Cross-Account Role (Role ARN)**
   - Enter the **Role ARN** of the role you created
   - Give the integration a unique name
   - Select the AWS services you want to monitor

**Required Permissions**

ProjectDiscovery needs read-only access to your AWS assets. The following AWS-managed policies are recommended:

- EC2 - AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess
- Route53 - AmazonRoute53ReadOnlyAccess
- S3 - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
- Lambda - AWSLambda_ReadOnlyAccess
- ELB - ElasticLoadBalancingReadOnly
- Cloudfront - CloudFrontReadOnlyAccess

Alternatively, you can use this custom policy for minimal permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "RequiredReadPermissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeRegions",
        "route53:ListHostedZones",
        "route53:ListResourceRecordSets",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "lambda:ListFunctions",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth",
        "cloudfront:ListDistributions",
        "ecs:ListClusters",
        "ecs:ListServices",
        "ecs:ListTasks",
        "ecs:DescribeTasks",
        "ecs:DescribeContainerInstances",
        "eks:ListClusters",
        "eks:DescribeCluster",
        "apigateway:GET",
        "lightsail:GetInstances",
        "lightsail:GetRegions"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Verifying the Integration**

After configuring the integration, it's important to verify that ProjectDiscovery is successfully connected and enumerating your AWS assets:

- **Check Asset Discovery:** In the ProjectDiscovery platform, navigate to the cloud assets or inventory section. After a successful integration, you should start seeing resources from your AWS account(s) listed (for example, EC2 instance IDs, S3 bucket names, etc., corresponding to the integrated accounts). It may take a short while for the initial discovery to complete. If you see those assets, the integration is working.
- **Test with a Known Resource:** As a quick test, pick a known resource (like a specific EC2 instance or S3 bucket in your AWS account) and search for it in ProjectDiscovery's asset inventory. If it appears, the connection is functioning and pulling data.
- **Troubleshooting Errors:** If the integration fails or some assets are missing, consider these common issues:
  - _Incorrect Credentials:_ Double-check that the Access Key and Secret (if used) were entered correctly and correspond to an active IAM user. If you recently created the user, ensure you copied the keys exactly (no extra spaces or missing characters).
  - _Insufficient Permissions:_ If certain services aren't showing up, the IAM policy might be missing permissions. For example, if S3 buckets aren't listed, confirm that the policy includes `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`. Refer back to the Required Permissions and make sure all relevant actions are allowed. You can also use AWS IAM Policy Simulator or CloudTrail logs to see if any **AccessDenied** errors occur when ProjectDiscovery calls AWS APIs.
  - _Assume Role Failures:_ In multi-account or cross-account setups, a common issue is a misconfigured trust relationship. If ProjectDiscovery cannot assume a role, you might see an error in the UI or logs like "AccessDenied: Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRole". In that case, check the following:
    - The trust policy of the IAM role (in target account) trusts the correct principal (either your primary account's IAM user/role ARN for multi-account, or ProjectDiscovery's external account ID for cross-account) and the External ID if applicable.
    - The role name or ARN in the ProjectDiscovery config exactly matches the one in AWS (spelling/case must match).
    - The primary credentials (for multi-account) have permission to call `AssumeRole`.
  - _External ID Mismatch:_ For cross-account roles, if the external ID in ProjectDiscovery and the one in the IAM role's trust policy do not match, AWS will deny the assume request. Ensure you didn't accidentally copy the wrong value or include extra spaces. It must be exact.
- **AWS CloudTrail Logs:** As an additional verification, you can check AWS CloudTrail in your account. When ProjectDiscovery connects, you should see events like `DescribeInstances`, `ListBuckets`, etc., being called by the IAM user or assumed role. For cross-account roles, you will see an `AssumeRole` event from ProjectDiscovery's AWS account ID, and subsequent calls under the assumed role's identity. This audit trail can confirm that the integration is working as intended and using only allowed actions.

If all checks out, ProjectDiscovery is now actively monitoring your AWS environment. New resources launched in AWS should be detected on the next scan cycle, and any changes to your cloud footprint will be reflected in the platform. Make sure to regularly review the integration and update the IAM permissions if you start using new AWS services.

ProjectDiscovery's GCP integration allows the platform to automatically discover and monitor cloud assets across your GCP account. The integration supports **two discovery approaches** to accommodate different organizational structures and permission models.

<img
  src="/images/GCP_integration_screen.png"
  alt="GCP Integration Screen Pn"
  title="GCP Integration Screen Pn"
  style={{ width:"61%" }}
/>

Supported GCP Services:

- [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns)
- [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
- [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute)
- [Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)
- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

**GCP Integration Methods:**

1. **Organization-Level Asset API** (Recommended for Enterprises)
   - Uses Google Cloud's **Asset Inventory API** for comprehensive organization-wide discovery
   - Discovers assets across entire GCP organization with a single configuration
   - Requires organization-level permissions: `roles/cloudasset.viewer` and `roles/resourcemanager.viewer`
   - Ideal for large organizations with multiple projects

2. **Individual Service APIs** (Default)
   - Uses individual GCP service APIs for project-specific discovery
   - Faster execution with detailed resource metadata
   - Requires project-level permissions for each service
   - Ideal for focused, single-project discovery

**Service Account Setup:**

`Service Account Key` can be retrieved by creating a new service account. For individual service APIs, create service account with Read Only access to `cloudresourcemanager` and `dns` scopes in IAM. For organization-level discovery, grant organization-level Asset API permissions. Generate a new account key for the Service Account by following steps in Reference 2. This should give you a json which can be pasted in a single line in the `Service Account Key` input box.

Scopes Required: Cloud DNS, GKE, Cloud Asset Inventory (for org-level discovery)
