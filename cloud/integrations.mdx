### Slack

ProjectDiscovery supports scan notifications through Slack. To enable Slack notifications provide a name for your Configuration, a webhook, and an optional username.

Choose from the list of **Events** (Scan Started, Scan Finished, Scan Failed) to specify what notifications are generated. All Events are selected by default

* Refer to Slack's [documentation on creating webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for configuration details.

### MS Teams

ProjectDiscovery supports notifications through Microsoft Teams. To enable notifications, provide a name for your Configuration and a corresponding webhook.

Choose from the list of **Events** (Scan Started, Scan Finished, Scan Failed)  to specify what notifications are generated.

* Refer to [Microsoft’s documentation on creating webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet) for configuration details.

### Email

ProjectDiscovery supports notifications via Email. To enable email notifications for completed scans simply add your recipient email addresses.


### Webhook

ProjectDiscovery supports custom webhook notifications, allowing you to post events to any HTTP endpoint that matches your infrastructure requirements.

To implement webhook notifications, provide:

* Configuration name

* Webhook URL

* Authentication parameters (if required)

Example endpoint format:

```
https://your-domain.com/api/security/alerts
```

## Ticketing Integrations

The integrations under Ticketing support ticketing functionality as part of scanning and include support for Jira, GitHub, GitLab, and Linear. Navigate to [Scans → Configurations → Ticketing](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/scans/configs?type=reporting) to configure your ticketing tools.

<img height="300" src="/images/platform/scansticketing.png" />

### Jira

ProjectDiscovery provides integration support for Jira to create new tickets when vulnerabilities are found.

Provide a name for the configuration, the Jira instance URL , the Account ID, the Email, and the associated API token.

Details on creating an API token are available [in the Jira documentation here.](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)

### GitHub

ProjectDiscovery provides integration support for GitHub to create new tickets when vulnerabilities are found.

Provide a name for the configuration, the Organization or username, Project name, Issue Assignee, Token, and Issue Label. The Issue Label determines when a ticket is created. (For example, if critical severity is selected, any issues with a critical severity will create a ticket.)

* The severity as label option adds a template result severity to any GitHub issues created.

* Deduplicate posts any new results as comments on existing issues instead of creating new issues for the same result.

Details on setting up access in GitHub [are available here.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

### GitLab

ProjectDiscovery provides integration support for GitLab to create new tickets when vulnerabilities are found.

Provide your GitLab username, Project name, Project Access Token and a GitLab Issue label. The Issue Label determines when a ticket is created.
(For example, if critical severity is selected, any issues with a critical severity will create a ticket.)

* The severity as label option adds a template result severity to any GitLab issues created.

* Deduplicate posts any new results as comments on existing issues instead of creating new issues for the same result.

Refer to GitLab’s documentation for details on [configuring a Project Access token.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#create-a-project-access-token)

### Linear

ProjectDiscovery integrates with Linear for automated issue tracking. The integration requires the following API parameters:

1. Linear API Key

2. Linear Team ID

3. Linear Open State ID

To retrieve these parameters:

1. **API Key Generation**:

   * Path: Linear > Settings > API > Personal API keys

   * Direct URL: linear.app/\[workspace]/settings/api

2. **Team ID Retrieval**:

```graphql
query {
  teams {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Open State ID Retrieval**:

```graphql
query {
  workflowStates {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [Linear API Documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api).

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RequiredReadPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [

#### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Supported GCP Services:

* [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns)

* [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)

* [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute)

* [Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage)

* [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)

* [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

**Example Config:**

Google Cloud Platform can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- provider: gcp # provider is the name of the provider
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  id: logs
  # gcp_service_account_key is the minified json of a google cloud service account with list permissions
  gcp_service_account_key: '{xxxxxxxxxxxxx}'
```

`gcp_service_account_key` can be retrieved by creating a new service account. To do so, create service account with Read Only access to `cloudresourcemanager` and `dns` scopes in IAM. Next, generate a new account key for the Service Account by following steps in Reference 2. This should give you a json which can be pasted in a single line in the `gcp_service_account_key`.

Scopes Required: Cloud DNS, GKE
