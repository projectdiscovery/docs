  <Accordion title="What are Nuclei templates?">
    Nuclei [templates](http://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) are the core of the Nuclei project and ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform. The templates contain the actual logic that is executed in order to detect various vulnerabilities. 
    
    The ProjectDiscovery template library contains **several thousand** ready-to-use **[community-contributed](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/graphs/contributors)** vulnerability templates. We are continuously working with our open source community 
    to update and add templates as vulnerabilities are discovered.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I write Nuclei templates?">
  We maintain a [template guide](/templates/introduction/) for writing new and
  custom Nuclei templates. ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform also provides AI
  support to assist in writing and testing custom templates. - Check out our
  documentation on the [Templates Editor](/cloud/editor/ai) for more
  information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can writing Nuclei templates help me or my organization?">
    Performing security assessment of an application is time-consuming. It's always better and time-saving to automate steps whenever possible. Once you've found a security vulnerability, you can prepare a Nuclei template by defining the required HTTP request to reproduce the issue, and test the same vulnerability across multiple hosts with ease. 
    It's worth mentioning ==you write the template once and use it forever==, as you don't need to manually test that specific vulnerability any longer.

    Here are few examples from the community making use of templates to automate the security findings:

<Accordion title="How do I run Nuclei templates in the Cloud Platform?">
Nuclei templates are selected as part of any scans you create. You can select pre-configured groups of templates, individual templates, or add your own custom templates as part of your scan configuration.

- Check out [the scanning documentation](/cloud/scanning/overview) to learn more.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I contribute a Nuclei template?">
  You are always welcome to share your templates with the community. You can
  either open a [GitHub
  issue](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&labels=nuclei-template&template=submit-template.md&title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+template-name)
  with the template details or open a GitHub [pull
  request](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/pulls) with your
  Nuclei templates. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can also make use of
  the [discord server](https://discord.gg/projectdiscovery) to share the
  template with us.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who owns the templates generated by the AI?">
  You own any templates generated by the AI through the Template Editor. They
  are your property, and you are granted a perpetual license to use and modify
  them as you see fit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you use a public or private LLM?">
  The Template Editor feature in PDCP uses OpenAI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you store the prompts, and what is your data retention policy?">
  Yes, prompts are stored as part of the generated template metadata. This data
  is deleted as soon as the template or the user are deleted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How accurate are the templates generated by the AI?">
  The accuracy of the generated templates is primarily dependent on the detail
  and specificity of the input you provide. The more detailed information you
  supply, the better the AI can understand the context and create an accurate
  template. However, as with any AI tool, it is highly recommended to review,
  validate, and test any generated templates before using them in a live
  environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does your LLM or AI learn from the templates I generate?">
  No, AI does not use the templates you generate for further training or
  improvement of the AI model. The system only uses public templates and CVE
  data for training, ensuring your unique templates remain confidential.
