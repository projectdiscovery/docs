## Summary 

As organizations uncover more vulnerabilities than ever before, managing and remediating critical security vulnerabilities becomes increasingly complex. Traditional workflows often involve fragmented tools and processes, making it challenging to ensure vulnerabilities are effectively resolved and do not reappear. 

Recognizing these challenges, we have added a powerful feature to our cloud platform (currently in BETA): Vulnerability Regression with Nuclei.

This feature seamlessly integrates with your preferred ticketing solutions—GitHub, GitLab, Linear, and Jira—to streamline vulnerability management. By automatically generating Nuclei templates from reported vulnerabilities and continuously retesting during the remediation process, it ensures that security issues are effectively fixed.


### How It Helps

- **Automates Template Creation**: Transforms reported vulnerabilities into actionable Nuclei templates using AI, saving time and reducing manual effort with ability to quickly edit the attached templates.

- **Continuous Retesting**: Automatically retests vulnerabilities when developers attempt to close issues, ensuring fixes are properly applied, and includes continuous monitoring of previously fixed vulnerabilities to file a ticket as soon as they reappear in production.

- **Infrastructure-wide Detection**: Identifies similar vulnerabilities across all assets, preventing overlooked threats and reducing the risk of reoccurrence.
