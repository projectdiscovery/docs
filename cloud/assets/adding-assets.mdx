## Overview

Assets in our cloud platform can be any hosts you want to monitor - URLs, IP addresses, or CIDR ranges. There are three primary methods to add assets:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Asset Discovery

The fastest way to get started is through our asset discovery feature:

1. Navigate to **Assets â†’ Add New Assets**
2. Enter root domains/CIDR/IPs.

<Note>
  Discovery features can be customized for Enterprise plans. Contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@projectdiscovery.io) for custom requirements.

<Note>
  **Cloudflare Port Exclusions**: By default, the asset discovery process excludes [Cloudflare proxy-compatible ports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/network-ports/#network-ports-compatible-with-cloudflares-proxy) during enumeration to optimize scanning efficiency and reduce noise. This includes ports 8080, 8880, 8443, 2052, 2082, 2086, 2095, 2053, 2083, 2087, and 2096 when Cloudflare infrastructure is detected. Standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80, 443) are not excluded. This behavior is enabled by default and cannot be configured by users. If you need to disable this exclusion behavior, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@projectdiscovery.io).
