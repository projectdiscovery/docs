## Summary
Assets are any hosts added to ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) for scanning. Hosts can be a URL, an IP address, or a CIDR range.

Assets can be added through either the Assets tab, or during the creation of a scan. Regardless of the path, adding assets to the Cloud Platform is the first step to running a scan and securing your tech stack against exploitable vulnerabilities.

From the Assets tab, there are three methods to add your assets: 
 - Add New Assets
 - Connect Cloud Services
 - HttpX Integration

 Each unique path, including those with specified ports will be added as an individual asset for scanning. If you have questions about your specific setup, get in touch with us at support@projectdiscovery.io.

 ## Discover New Assets 

 Discovery is the easiest method of importing assets into PDCP for vulnerability scanning.

- **Scope**: manually input your list of up to 10 root domains in the Free plan, or up to 100 root domains in Pro. 

   - Auto Discovery is enabled by default and will automatically discover your assets including subdomains, open ports, and other web technologies. Port scanning and technology detection is available in Pro and Enterprise plans only. 
   - *Note: Disable Auto Discovery to restrict upload to your specified asset list.* 

- Domain, IP address, or CIDR. For CIDR ranges each individual IP will be added as a single asset.

- **Advanced**: Turning off Auto Discovery disables all discovery settings. 

  - Use Advanced to modify individual discovery settings for subdomains, open ports, etc. 
  - Customize the frequency of Auto Discovery to continuously monitor for new assets.

<Info> Check out [What is exposed?](/cloud/examples/addassets) for an example of adding assets for Discovery or Cloud Integration. </Info>

## Connect Cloud Services

The **Connect Cloud Services** option connects your PDCP environment to any of our supported cloud providers and pull in assets once configured. Cloud connections can be configured to check for updates to your assets daily and ensure your assets are up to date.

To learn more about setting up integrations with your cloud provider, see [Add Cloud Assets](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/cloud/examples/addcloudassets) and our [Cloudlist documentation](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/cloudlist/providers)


## HttpX Integration

See HttpX Integration [docs](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/httpx/running#ui-dashboard-pdcp-integration) and [blog](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/introducing-httpx-dashboard-2/) for more details.

## Managing Assets

Once your assets are added successfully they display in the asset list.

 - Use the context menu to rename, **Update** to add or remove assets, Re-Discover, or Delete.
 - Uploaded assets are immediately available to use in scans.
 - Assets that are part of an existing scan cannot be deleted.
