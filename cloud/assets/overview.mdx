## Overview
In the ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP), an asset is any host or target for vulnerability scanning. An asset is defined as the combination of a host (subdomain or IP address) and a specific port.

Assets can be discovered via Auto-Discovery from a root domain or specified IP/CIDR range. Note: IP and CIDR range discovery and enrichment are only available on Pro and Enterprise plans.

Assets can also be imported through our cloud integrations or direct upload through a .txt file. 

Once assets are added to PDCP, they can be selected as targets in a vulnerability scan.

## FAQ

### General
**Is there a limitation to how many root domains I can run auto-discovery on?**

The Free tier supports up to 10 root domain discoveries per month, while Pro supports 100 domains per month and Enterprise offers custom limits. 

**What kind of Assets are supported?**

Assets or hosts can be a URL, an IP address, a root domain, or a CIDR range. 

**Can everyone in my team see all the Assets that were added to my environment?**

Yes, all assets in your environment are shared across your team.

### Assets and Scans

**Can I exempt specific assets from a scan?**

Building a new scan requires you to choose assets as part of the scan configuration, so yes, scans will apply to whatever assets you include in the scan. 

### Adding and Modifying Assets

**What's the difference between Add Assets, cloud integration?**

 - Add allows you to choose a list of individual assets or root domains to add as a list or TXT file.
   
   - Enabling **Auto Discovery** automatically enumerates associated subdomains and open ports. Each subdomain or unique path identified is added as individual asset.

 - Cloud Integrations connect your cloud service provider and import any assets identified. 

**Can I edit existing Assets?** 

Yes! Assets that are added to PDCP can be renamed.

**Can I delete Assets?**

You can delete any assets, however assets that are included in a scan will generate an error.
