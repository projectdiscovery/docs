Attack Surface Management (ASM) has evolved from basic asset enumeration into a sophisticated process that continuously discovers, classifies, and monitors all assets vulnerable to attack. Modern organizations face ever‐expanding digital footprints spanning traditional internet-facing systems, dynamic cloud environments, and complex distributed services. ProjectDiscovery redefines ASM by combining proven open‑source techniques with advanced cloud‑native capabilities. This unified platform delivers instant insights—through a search‑like experience and deep reconnaissance—ensuring comprehensive coverage and real‑time visibility into your entire infrastructure. In essence, it lets your security team see your organization's attack surface as an attacker would, leaving no blind spots.

This document outlines the core workflows and architectural components of ProjectDiscovery's ASM and Exposure Management. It is designed to help new users quickly understand how the system works and to provide a structured, yet developer‑friendly, overview for security and engineering teams.

## Platform Architecture

Our next‑generation asset discovery platform is built on a revolutionary three‑layer architecture developed through extensive collaboration with hundreds of security teams. Each layer plays a distinct role in mapping and monitoring your infrastructure.

### 1. External Discovery Layer

- **Instant Enumeration:** Leveraging our enhanced Chaos database, this layer delivers immediate results through pre‑indexed data for hundreds of thousands of domains.
- **Deep Reconnaissance:** Active reconnaissance methods (advanced DNS brute‑forcing, permutation analysis, certificate transparency log monitoring) supplement instant results.
- **ASN Mapping:** Sophisticated ASN correlation (ASNMap) uncovers hidden relationships by mapping IP ranges associated with your organization. This network‑level insight expands your visibility beyond known domains.
- **Third‑Party Data & Subsidiary Discovery:** Integration with external sources (e.g., Shodan, Censys, FOFA) and subsidiary detection mechanisms automatically identify related brands and assets—ensuring that acquired or lesser‑known entities are not overlooked.

### 2. Cloud Integration Layer

- **Real‑Time Cloud Asset Discovery:** Our enhanced Cloudlist engine connects natively with AWS, Azure, GCP, and more, continuously monitoring your cloud footprint.
- **Service & Configuration Monitoring:** Advanced heuristics identify exposed services and risky configurations in real‑time, while persistent API connections ensure your cloud inventory stays up‑to‑date.
- **Cross‑Cloud Correlation:** Cloud‑based assets are linked with ASN data and external discoveries to provide a unified view of your overall attack surface.

### 3. Asset Management Layer

- **Enrichment & Classification:** Raw asset data is transformed through multi‑stage analysis. Comprehensive DNS analysis, HTTP probing (with screenshots and technology fingerprinting), and certificate evaluation work together to create detailed asset profiles.
- **Automated Labeling:** AI‑powered models automatically categorize and tag assets based on their characteristics, behavior patterns, and risk profiles. Users can also define custom labels and apply bulk labeling to further organize assets by environment, ownership, or risk.
- **Graph‑Based Relationship Mapping:** Advanced mapping visualizes complex asset relationships and attack paths, providing actionable intelligence for prioritizing security efforts.

## Best Practices & Next Steps

- **Enable Continuous Scanning:** Schedule regular asset discovery and vulnerability scans to ensure your inventory remains current.
- **Leverage Labels Effectively:** Develop a consistent labeling scheme that reflects your organizational structure (e.g. by environment, department, or risk level) to prioritize remediation efforts.
- **Integrate with Your Workflow:** Set up integrations with alerting systems (Slack, Teams, email) and ticketing tools (Jira, GitHub) to automate notifications and track remediation.
- **Review & Update Regularly:** Periodically audit your asset inventory to remove stale entries and adjust labels as your infrastructure evolves.
- **Explore Advanced Features:** Once you're comfortable with the basics, dive into additional features such as customized filtering, dynamic grouping, and deeper cloud integrations to further refine your exposure management.
