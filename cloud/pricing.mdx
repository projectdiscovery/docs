<Info>
**Note for Individual Researchers & Pentesters**: 
Our Pro tier is specifically designed for organizations and teams. If you're an individual researcher or pentester, we recommend sticking with our Free tier while we actively develop more individual-focused features. We believe in being transparent - if a feature you need isn't available in the Free tier yet, our open-source tools might be a better fit for now. We're working hard to expand our Free tier capabilities!
