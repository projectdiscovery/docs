Our cloud platform combines real-world attack detection with comprehensive vulnerability management. By leveraging our battle-tested open-source security tools used by over 100,000 security professionals worldwide, our platform helps organizations focus on what matters most - truly exploitable security risks.

While traditional vulnerability management tools focus on CVE matching and version scanning, ProjectDiscovery takes an attacker's perspective:
