ProjectDiscovery is a modern **vulnerability management** platform that detects exploitable vulnerabilities across your entire infrastructure—external, internal, and cloud. By validating exploitability at runtime and surfacing only action-ready findings, it eliminates noise and helps teams remediate real risks faster than ever. Below is an overview of its key capabilities:

Unified Asset Discovery & Continuous Monitoring
</div>

- Continuously discovers and inventories both internet-exposed **and** internal/cloud assets—VMs, load balancers, Kubernetes ingresses, sub-domains, and more—keeping your inventory always up to date
- Continuously tracks changes so new hosts, endpoints, or configuration drifts never slip through the cracks, ensuring complete visibility across your attack surface

<div className="text-gray-900 dark:text-white font-semibold">
Validated, Actionable Findings
</div>

- Safe, real-world attack simulation validates exploits at runtime, ensuring every vulnerability surfaced is **actually exploitable**
- Attacker-centric methodology prioritizes the weaknesses real adversaries target, eliminating alert fatigue
- Results are noise-free—teams report up to **97 % manual triage time saved**
- Automated retest and remediation workflows accelerate fix verification and prevent regressions

<div className="text-gray-900 dark:text-white font-semibold">
Community-Powered Updates
</div>

- Stays in sync with the latest threats via a real-time community feed of new vulnerability templates and attack techniques
- ProjectDiscovery's global user community continuously contributes and updates these detection templates (for trending exploits, emerging CVEs, etc.)
- Our internal security team validates each contribution for quality and safety before release, ensuring reliable and secure detection templates
- Ensures you're quickly alerted to new attack vectors as soon as they arise

Each of these capabilities works together to give security teams and developers an accurate, noise-free view of their true security risks. By focusing on what attackers can really exploit (rather than just matching CVEs), ProjectDiscovery helps organizations address the most critical vulnerabilities first, with confidence and speed.
