# stop at first match Schema

```txt
https://template#/$defs/Template/properties/stop-at-first-match
```

stop-at-first-match stops the execution of template as soon as first match/result was found in a template given that template was sending multiple requests
this is required in case of default-login , brute-force and even detection templates where multiple requests are sent from template but we want to exit as soon as first match/result was found
Example:

```yaml
stop-at-first-match: true
```
