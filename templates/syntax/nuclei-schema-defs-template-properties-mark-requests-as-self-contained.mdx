# mark requests as self-contained Schema

```txt
https://template#/$defs/Template/properties/self-contained
```

Self-contained marks all requests in this template as independent of input which means input/target is not required for execution of template
but other variables defined in template need to be explicitly set using -V flag
Default value is false
Note: self-contained templates only run once regardless of how many targets where provided to nuclei
Example:

```yaml
self-contained: true
```

Full example template of self-contained is available at <https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/aws-app-enum>
