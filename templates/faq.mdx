  <Accordion title="What are Nuclei templates?" icon="circle-info" iconType="solid">
    Nuclei [templates](http://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) are the core of the Nuclei project. The templates contain the actual logic that is executed in order to detect various vulnerabilities. The project consists of **several thousand** ready-to-use **[community-contributed](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/graphs/contributors)** vulnerability templates.

  <Accordion title="How can I write Nuclei templates?" icon="circle-info" iconType="solid">
    We maintain a [template guide](/templates/introduction/) for writing new and custom Nuclei templates.

    Performing security assessment of an application is time-consuming. It's always better and time-saving to automate steps whenever possible. Once you've found a security vulnerability, you can prepare a Nuclei template by defining the required HTTP request to reproduce the issue, and test the same vulnerability across multiple hosts with ease. It's worth mentioning ==you write the template once and use it forever==, as you don't need to manually test that specific vulnerability any longer.

    Here are few examples from the community making use of templates to automate the security findings:

  <Accordion title="How do I run Nuclei templates?" icon="circle-info" iconType="solid">
    Nuclei templates can be executed using a template name or with tags, using `-templates` (`-t`) and `-tags` flag, respectively.

    ```
    nuclei -tags cve -list target_urls.txt
    ```

  <Accordion title="How can I contribute a Nuclei template?" icon="circle-info" iconType="solid">
   You are always welcome to share your templates with the community. You can either open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&labels=nuclei-template&template=submit-template.md&title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+template-name) with the template details or open a GitHub [pull request](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/pulls) with your nuclei templates. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can also make use of the [discord server](https://discord.gg/projectdiscovery) to share the template with us.

  <Accordion title="I'm getting false-positive results!" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid">
    The Nuclei template project is a **community-contributed project**. The ProjectDiscovery team manually reviews templates before merging them into the project. Still, there is a possibility that some templates with weak matchers will slip through the verification. This could produce false-positive results. **Templates are only as good as their matchers.**

    If you identified templates producing false positive/negative results, here are few steps that you can follow to fix them quickly.

          <Accordion title="I found a template producing false positive or negative results, but I'm not sure if this is accurate." icon="circle-info" iconType="solid">
           Direct message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pdnuclei) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/projectdiscovery) to confirm the validity of the template.
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="I found a template producing false positive or negative result and I don't know how to fix it." icon="circle-info" iconType="solid">
           Please open a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&labels=false-positive&template=false-positive.md&title=%5Bfalse-positive%5D+template-name+) with details, and we will work to address the problem and update the template.

  <Accordion title="Why can't I run all Nuclei templates?" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid">
    The Nuclei templates project houses a variety of templates which perform fuzzing and other actions which may result in a DoS against the target system (see [the list here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/.nuclei-ignore)). To ensure  these templates are not accidentally run, they are tagged and excluded them from the default scan. These templates can be only executed when explicitly invoked using the `-itags` option.

  When you download or update Nuclei templates using the Nuclei binary, it
  downloads all the templates from the latest **release**. All templates added
  after the release exist in the [master
  branch](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) and are added to
  Nuclei when a new template release is created.
