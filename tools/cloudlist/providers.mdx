## Major Cloud Providers

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Supported AWS Services:
  - [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
  - [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
  - [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
  - [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
  - [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
  - [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
  - [ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)
  - [ELBv2](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)
  - [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
  - [Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/)
  - [Apigateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

**Example Config**:
Amazon Web Services can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- provider: aws # provider is the name of the provider
  # id is the name defined by user for filtering (optional)
  id: staging
  # aws_access_key is the access key for AWS account
  aws_access_key: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  # aws_secret_key is the secret key for AWS account
  aws_secret_key: $AWS_SECRET_KEY
  # aws_session_token session token for temporary security credentials retrieved via STS (optional)
  aws_session_token: $AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
  # assume_role_name is the name of the role to assume (optional)
  assume_role_name: $AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_NAME
  # account_ids is the aws account ids which has similar assumed role name (optional)
  account_ids:
    - $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_1
    - $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_2
```

`aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` can be generated in the IAM console. We recommend creating a new IAM user with `Read Only` permissions and providing the access token for the user.

Scopes Required: 

The following scopes can directly be provided to the IAM user.

```
EC2 - AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess
Route53 - AmazonRoute53ReadOnlyAccess
S3 - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
Lambda - AWSLambda_ReadOnlyAccess
ELB - ElasticLoadBalancingReadOnly
Cloudfront - CloudFrontReadOnlyAccess
```

To also support other services, a custom policy document is provided which can directly be copy-pasted to the role to allow correct and minimal permissions.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RequiredReadPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "route53:ListHostedZones",
                "route53:ListResourceRecordSets",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "lambda:ListFunctions",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth",
                "cloudfront:ListDistributions",
                "ecs:ListClusters",
                "ecs:ListServices",
                "ecs:ListTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:DescribeContainerInstances",
                "eks:ListClusters",
                "eks:DescribeCluster",
                "apigateway:GET",
                "lightsail:GetInstances",
                "lightsail:GetRegions"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
} 
```

### GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

Cloudlist supports two approaches for GCP asset discovery:

- **Organization-Level Asset API** - Comprehensive organization-wide discovery using Cloud Asset Inventory API
- **Individual Service APIs** - Fast project-specific discovery using individual GCP service APIs

#### Individual Service APIs (Default)

Supported GCP Services:
  - [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns)
  - [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
  - [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute)
  - [Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
  - [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)
  - [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

**Example Config:**

Google Cloud Platform can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- provider: gcp # provider is the name of the provider
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  id: logs
  # gcp_service_account_key is the minified json of a google cloud service account with list permissions
  gcp_service_account_key: '{xxxxxxxxxxxxx}'
```

`gcp_service_account_key` can be retrieved by creating a new service account. To do so, create service account with Read Only access to `cloudresourcemanager` and `dns` scopes in IAM. Next, generate a new account key for the Service Account by following steps in Reference 2. This should give you a json which can be pasted in a single line in the `gcp_service_account_key`.

Scopes Required: Cloud DNS, GKE

#### Organization-Level Asset API

The GCP Asset API provides comprehensive organization-wide asset discovery using the Cloud Asset Inventory API. This approach is more efficient for large organizations with multiple projects and provides a unified view of all assets.

**Example Config:**

```yaml
- provider: gcp # provider is the name of the provider
  id: organization
  # gcp_service_account_key is the minified json of a google cloud service account with asset inventory permissions
  gcp_service_account_key: '{xxxxxxxxxxxxx}'
  # use_asset_inventory enables the Cloud Asset Inventory API
  use_asset_inventory: true
  # organization_id is the organization ID (e.g., "123456789012")
  organization_id: $GCP_ORGANIZATION_ID
  # project_ids is a list of project IDs to scan (optional - if not provided, all projects in the organization will be scanned)
  project_ids:
    - $GCP_PROJECT_ID_1
    - $GCP_PROJECT_ID_2
```

**Required Permissions for Asset API:**

For organization-level asset discovery, the service account needs the following IAM roles:

- `roles/cloudasset.viewer` - To read asset inventory data
- `roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer` - To list organization resources
- `roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer` - To list folder resources (if using folders)
- `roles/browser` - To browse project resources

**Custom IAM Policy for Asset API:**

```json
{
  "Version": "1",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources",
        "cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies",
        "cloudasset.assets.listAssets",
        "resourcemanager.organizations.get",
        "resourcemanager.projects.list",
        "resourcemanager.folders.list"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits of Asset API:**

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Discovers all supported GCP resource types in one API call
- **Organization-wide Visibility**: Scans across all projects and folders in an organization
- **Efficient**: Reduces the number of API calls compared to individual service APIs
- **Consistent**: Provides a unified view of assets across all GCP services
- **Historical Data**: Access to asset history and change tracking

**Supported Asset Types via Asset API:**

The Asset API can discover a wide range of GCP resources including:
- Compute instances, disks, networks, firewalls
- Cloud Storage buckets and objects
- Cloud SQL instances and databases
- Kubernetes clusters and nodes
- Cloud Functions
- App Engine services
- Load balancers and networking resources
- And many more...

### Azure

Supported Azure Services:
  - Virtual Machines

**Example Config:**

Microsoft Azure can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- provider: azure # provider is the name of the provider
  # id is the name defined by user for filtering (optional)
  id: staging
  # client_id is the client ID of registered application of the azure account (not requuired if using cli auth)
  client_id: $AZURE_CLIENT_ID
  # client_secret is the secret ID of registered application of the zure account (not requuired if using cli uth)
  client_secret: $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
  # tenant_id is the tenant ID of registered application of the azure account (not requuired if using cli auth)
  tenant_id: $AZURE_TENANT_ID
  #subscription_id is the azure subscription id
  subscription_id: $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
  #use_cli_auth if set to true cloudlist will use azure cli auth
  use_cli_auth: true
```

`tenant_id`, `client_id`, `client_secret` can be obtained/generated from   `All services` > `Azure Active Directory` > `App registrations`
`subscription_id` can be retrieved from  `All services` > `Subscriptions`

To use cli auth set `use_cli_auth` value to `true` and run `az login` in the terminal
