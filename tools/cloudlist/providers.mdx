## Major Cloud Providers

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Supported AWS Services:
  - [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
  - [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
  - [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
  - [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
  - [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
  - [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
  - [ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)
  - [ELBv2](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)
  - [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
  - [Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/)
  - [Apigateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

**Example Config**:
Amazon Web Services can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- provider: aws # provider is the name of the provider
  # id is the name defined by user for filtering (optional)
  id: staging
  # aws_access_key is the access key for AWS account
  aws_access_key: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  # aws_secret_key is the secret key for AWS account
  aws_secret_key: $AWS_SECRET_KEY
  # aws_session_token session token for temporary security credentials retrieved via STS (optional)
  aws_session_token: $AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
  # assume_role_name is the name of the role to assume (optional)
  assume_role_name: $AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_NAME
  # account_ids is the aws account ids which has similar assumed role name (optional)
  account_ids:
    - $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_1
    - $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_2
```

`aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` can be generated in the IAM console. We recommend creating a new IAM user with `Read Only` permissions and providing the access token for the user.

Scopes Required: Read EC2, Route53, S3

### GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

Supported GCP Services:
  - [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns)
  - [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
  - [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute)
  - [Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
  - [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)
  - [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

**Example Config:**

Google Cloud Platform can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml
- provider: gcp # provider is the name of the provider
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  id: logs
  # gcp_service_account_key is the minified json of a google cloud service account with list permissions
  gcp_service_account_key: '{xxxxxxxxxxxxx}'
```


`gcp_service_account_key` can be retrieved by creating a new service account. To do so, create service account with Read Only access to `cloudresourcemanager` and `dns` scopes in IAM. Next, generate a new account key for the Service Account by following steps in Reference 2. This should give you a json which can be pasted in a single line in the `gcp_service_account_key`.

Scopes Required: Cloud DNS, GKE

### Azure

Supported Azure Services:
  - Virtual Machines

**Example Config:**

Microsoft Azure can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

```yaml

  #subscription_id is the azure subscription id
  subscription_id: $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
  #use_cli_auth if set to true cloudlist will use azure cli auth
  use_cli_auth: true
```

`tenant_id`, `client_id`, `client_secret` can be obtained/generated from   `All services` > `Azure Active Directory` > `App registrations`
`subscription_id` can be retrieved from  `All services` > `Subscriptions`

To use cli auth set `use_cli_auth` value to `true` and run `az login` in the terminal

### Hashicorp Tools

With Cloudlist you can get assets from nomad, consul and terraform. Cloudlist can query Nomad and Consul directly, and will use the Terraform state file to list Terraform created assets.

#### Nomad

Hashicorp Nomad can be integrated by using the following configuration block.

**Example Config:**

```yaml
- provider: nomad # provider is the name of the provider
  # nomad_url is the url for nomad server
  nomad_url: http:/127.0.0.1:4646/
