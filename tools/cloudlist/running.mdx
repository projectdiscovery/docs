# Cloudlist as a library

It's possible to use the library directly in your go programs. The following code snippets outline how to list assets from all or given cloud provider.

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "log"

  "github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/pkg/inventory"
  "github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/pkg/schema"
)

func main() {
  inventory, err := inventory.New(schema.Options{
    schema.OptionBlock{"provider": "digitalocean", "digitalocean_token": "ec405badb974fd3d891c9223245f9ab5871c127fce9e632c8dc421edd46d7242"},
  })
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("%s\n", err)
  }

  for _, provider := range inventory.Providers {
    resources, err := provider.Resources(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("%s\n", err)
    }
    for _, resource := range resources.Items {
      _ = resource // Do something with the resource
    }
  }
}
```
