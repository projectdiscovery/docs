## What is **Nuclei?**

Nuclei is a fast vulnerability scanner designed to probe modern applications, infrastructure, cloud platforms, and networks, aiding in the identification and mitigation of exploitable vulnerabilities.

At its core, Nuclei uses templatesâ€”expressed as straightforward YAML files, that delineate methods for detecting, ranking, and addressing specific security flaws.

Each template delineates a possible attack route, detailing the vulnerability, its severity, priority rating, and occasionally associated exploits. This template-centric methodology ensures Nuclei not only identifies potential threats, but pinpoints exploitable vulnerabilities with tangible real-world implications.
