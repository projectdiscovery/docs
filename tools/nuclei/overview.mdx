## What is **Nuclei?**

Nuclei is a fast vulnerability scanner designed to probe modern applications, infrastructure, cloud platforms, and networks, aiding in the identification and mitigation of exploitable vulnerabilities.

At its core, Nuclei uses templates—expressed as straightforward YAML files, that delineate methods for detecting, ranking, and addressing specific security flaws.

Each template delineates a possible attack route, detailing the vulnerability, its severity, priority rating, and occasionally associated exploits. This template-centric methodology ensures Nuclei not only identifies potential threats, but pinpoints exploitable vulnerabilities with tangible real-world implications.
