## How to Run Nuclei

Nuclei templates offer two primary execution methods:


### Supported Input Formats

Nuclei supports various input formats to run template against, including urls, hosts, ips, cidrs, asn, openapi, swagger, proxify, burpsuite exported data and more. To learn more on using input specify options, you can refer [nuclei input formats](/tools/nuclei/input-formats).

These inputs can be given to nuclei using `-l` and `-input-mode` flags.

```console
  -l, -list string              path to file containing a list of target URLs/hosts to scan (one per line)
  -im, -input-mode string       mode of input file (list, burp, jsonl, yaml, openapi, swagger) (default "list")
```

  Executing nuclei against a list of inputs (urls, hosts, ips, cidrs, asn) is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
  nuclei -l targets.txt
```

  For running other input formats (burp, jsonl, yaml, openapi, swagger), you can use the `-im` flag to specify the input mode.

```bash
  nuclei -l targets.burp -im burp
```

```bash
  nuclei -l openapi.yaml -im openapi
```

and so on.


### Executing Nuclei Templates
`-t/templates`

**Default Templates**

Most community templates from our [nuclei-template repository](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) are executed by default, directly from the standard installation path. The typical command is as follows:

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com
```

However, there are some exceptions regarding the templates that run by default:

- Certain tags and templates listed in the [default `.nuclei-ignore` file](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/.nuclei-ignore) are not included.
- [Code Templates](/templates/protocols/code) require the `-code` flag to execute.
- [Headless Templates](/templates/protocols/headless) will not run unless you pass the `-headless` flag.
- [Fuzzing Templates](/template/protocols/http/fuzzing-overview) will not run unless you pass the `-fuzz` flag.
- A separate collection of [Fuzzing Templates](/templates/protocols/http/fuzzing-overview), located in a [different repository](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/fuzzing-templates), must be downloaded and configured separately for use.

You can also run templates against a list of URLs:

```sh
nuclei -list http_urls.txt
```

**Custom Templates**

To run a custom template directory or multiple directories, use the following command structure:

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -t cves/ -t exposures/
```

Templates from custom GitHub repositories, stored under the github directory, can be executed with this command:

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -t github/private-repo
```

You can also directly run a template from any ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform URL like this:

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -t https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/tech-detect
```

### Executing Template Workflows
`-w/workflows`

[Workflows](/templates/workflows/overview) can be executed using the following command:

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -w workflows/
```

Similarly, Workflows can be executed against a list of URLs.

```sh
nuclei -list http_urls.txt -w workflows/wordpress-workflow.yaml
```

## Types of Templates

### Template **Filters**

Nuclei engine supports three basic filters to customize template execution.

1. Tags (`-tags`)

   Filter based on tags field available in the template.

2. Severity (`-severity`)

   Filter based on severity field available in the template.

3. Author (`-author`)

   Filter based on author field available in the template.

As default, Filters are applied on installed path of templates and can be customized with manual template path input.

For example, below command will run all the templates installed at `~/nuclei-templates/` directory and has `cve` tags in it.

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -tags cve
```

And this example will run all the templates available under `~/nuclei-templates/exposures/` directory and has `config` tag in it.

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -tags config -t exposures/
```

Multiple filters works together with AND condition,
below example runs all templates with `cve` tags
AND has `critical` OR `high` severity AND `geeknik` as author of template.

```sh
nuclei -u https://example.com -tags cve -severity critical,high -author geeknik
```

### Advanced Filters

Multiple filters can also be combined using the template condition flag (`-tc`) that allows complex expressions like the following ones:

```sh
nuclei -tc "contains(id,'xss') || contains(tags,'xss')"
nuclei -tc "contains(tags,'cve') && contains(tags,'ssrf')"
nuclei -tc "contains(name, 'Local File Inclusion')"
```

The supported fields are:

- `id` string
- `name` string
- `description` string
- `tags` slice of strings
- `authors` slice of strings
- `severity` string
- `protocol` string
- `http_method` slice of strings
- `body` string (containing all request bodies if any)
- `matcher_type` slice of string
- `extractor_type` slice of string
- `description` string

Also, every key-value pair from the template metadata section is accessible. All fields can be combined with logical operators (`||` and `&&`) and used with DSL helper functions.

Similarly, all filters are supported in workflows as well.

```sh
nuclei -w workflows/wordpress-workflow.yaml -severity critical,high -list http_urls.txt
```

<Note>

**Workflows**

In Workflows, Nuclei filters are applied on templates or sub-templates running via workflows, not on the workflows itself.

</Note>

### Public Templates

Nuclei has built-in support for automatic template download/update from [**nuclei templates**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) project which provides [community-contributed](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates#-community) list of ready-to-use templates that is constantly updated.

Nuclei checks for new community template releases upon each execution and automatically downloads the latest version when available. optionally, this feature can be disabled using the `-duc` cli flag or the configuration file.

### Custom Templates

Users can create custom templates on a personal public / private GitHub / AWS Bucket that they wish to run / update while using nuclei from any environment without manually downloading the GitHub repository everywhere.

To use this feature, users need to set the following environment variables:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For GitHub Project" icon="pencil">
    ```bash
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=gh_XXX
    export GITHUB_TEMPLATE_REPO=my_nuclei_template
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="For GitLab Project" icon="pencil">
    ```bash
    export GITLAB_SERVER_URL=https://gitlab.com
    # The GitLab token must have the read_api and read_repository scope
    export GITLAB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXX
    # Comma separated list of repository IDs (not names)
    export GITLAB_REPOSITORY_IDS=12345,67890
    ```
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="For AWS Bucket" icon="pencil">

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=AKIAXXXXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_KEY=XXXXXX
export AWS_REGION=us-xxx-1
export AWS_TEMPLATE_BUCKET=aws_bucket_name
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="For Azure Blob Storage" icon="pencil">

```bash
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
export AZURE_SERVICE_URL=https://XXXXXXXXXX.blob.core.windows.net/
export AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME=templates
```

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Environment variables can also be provided to disable download from default and custom template locations:

```bash
# Disable download from the default nuclei-templates project
export DISABLE_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_PUBLIC_DOWNLOAD=true

# Disable download from public / private GitHub project(s)
export DISABLE_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_GITHUB_DOWNLOAD=true

# Disable download from public / private GitLab project(s)
export DISABLE_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_GITLAB_DOWNLOAD=true

# Disable download from public / private AWS Bucket(s)
export DISABLE_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_AWS_DOWNLOAD=true

# Disable download from public / private Azure Blob Storage
export DISABLE_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES_AZURE_DOWNLOAD=true
```

Once the environment variables are set, following command to download the custom templates:

```bash
nuclei -update-templates
```

This command will clone the repository containing the custom templates to the default nuclei templates directory (`$HOME/nuclei-templates/github/`).

The directory structure of the custom templates looks as follows:

```bash
tree $HOME/nuclei-templates/

nuclei-templates/
└── github/$GH_REPO_NAME # Custom templates downloaded from public / private GitHub project
└── gitlab/$GL_REPO_NAME # Custom templates downloaded from public / private GitLab project
└── s3/$BUCKET_NAME # Custom templates downloaded from public / private AWS Bucket
└── azure/$CONTAINER_NAME # Custom templates downloaded from public / private Azure Blob Storage
```

Users can then use the custom templates with the `-t` flag as follows:

```
nuclei -t github/my_custom_template -u https://example.com
```

The nuclei engine can be updated to latest version by using the `-update` flag.

<Tip>
  Writing your own unique templates will always keep you one step ahead of
  others.

CLOUD:
   -auth                  configure projectdiscovery cloud (pdcp) api key (default true)
   -cup, -cloud-upload    upload scan results to pdcp dashboard
   -sid, -scan-id string  upload scan results to given scan id

AUTHENTICATION:
   -sf, -secret-file string[]  path to config file containing secrets for nuclei authenticated scan
   -ps, -prefetch-secrets      prefetch secrets from the secrets file
```

<Tip>
  From Nuclei v3.0.0 `-metrics` port has been removed and merged with `-stats`
  when using `-stats` flag metrics will be by default available at `localhost:9092/metrics`
  and metrics-port can be configured by `-metrics-port` flag
</Tip>

### Rate **Limits**

Nuclei have multiple rate limit controls for multiple factors, including a number of templates to execute in parallel, a number of hosts to be scanned in parallel for each template, and the global number of request / per second you wanted to make/limit using nuclei, here is an example of each flag with description.

| Flag       | Description                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rate-limit | Control the total number of request to send per seconds              |
| bulk-size  | Control the number of hosts to process in parallel for each template |
| c          | Control the number of templates to process in parallel               |

Feel free to play with these flags to tune your nuclei scan speed and accuracy. For more details on tuning these flag, you can refer [mass-scanning-cli](/tools/nuclei/mass-scanning-cli)

<Tip>
  `rate-limit` flag takes precedence over the other two flags, the number of
  requests/seconds can't go beyond the value defined for `rate-limit` flag
  regardless the value of `c` and `bulk-size` flag.
</Tip>

### Traffic **Tagging**

Many BugBounty platform/programs requires you to identify the HTTP traffic you make, this can be achieved by setting custom header using config file at `$HOME/.config/nuclei/config.yaml` or CLI flag `-H / header`

<Note>
Setting custom header using config file

```yaml
# Headers to include with each request.
header:
  - 'X-BugBounty-Hacker: h1/geekboy'
  - 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) / nuclei'
```

</Note>

<Note>

Setting custom header using CLI flag

```yaml
nuclei -header 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) / nuclei' -list urls.txt -tags cves
```

</Note>

### Template **Exclusion**

Nuclei supports a variety of methods for excluding / blocking templates from execution. By default, **nuclei** excludes the tags/templates listed below from execution to avoid unexpected fuzz based scans and some that are not supposed to run for mass scan, and these can be easily overwritten with nuclei configuration file / flags.

Nuclei engine supports two ways to manually exclude templates from scan,

1. Exclude Templates (`-exclude-templates/exclude`)

   **exclude-templates** flag is used to exclude single or multiple templates and directory, multiple `-exclude-templates` flag can be used to provide multiple values.

2. Exclude Tags (`-exclude-tags/etags`)

   **exclude-tags** flag is used to exclude templates based in defined tags, single or multiple can be used to exclude templates.

<Note>
Example of excluding single template

```
nuclei -list urls.txt -t cves/ -exclude-templates cves/2020/CVE-2020-XXXX.yaml
```

</Note>

<Note>
Example of multiple template exclusion

```
nuclei -list urls.txt -exclude-templates exposed-panels/ -exclude-templates technologies/
```

</Note>

<Note>
Example of excluding templates with single tag

```
nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -etags xss
```

</Note>

<Note>
Example of excluding templates with multiple tags

```
nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -etags sqli,rce
```
</Note>

- [.nuclei-ignore](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/.nuclei-ignore) list - default list of tags and templates excluded from nuclei scan as default.

<Warning>
  **.nuclei-ignore** file is not supposed to be modified by
  user, as it gets used by nuclei internally, to overwrite ignore list, utilize [nuclei
  configuration](/tools/nuclei/running#nuclei-config) file.
</Warning>

To prioritize certain templates or tags over the [.nuclei-ignore](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/.nuclei-ignore) file or denylist, you must use the `-include-templates` or `-include-tags` flags. This will ensure that the specified templates or tags take precedence over any `.nuclei-ignore` or denylist entries.

<Note>
Example of running blocked templates

```bash
nuclei -l urls.txt -include-tags iot,misc,fuzz
```

</Note>

<Note>
Example of executing a specific template that is in the denylist

Say that you have custom templates globbed (`*`) in the denylist on the Nuclei configuration file.

```yaml
# ...

exclude-templates:
  - 'custom/**/*.yaml'
```

But you just want to execute a specific template.

```bash
nuclei -l urls.txt -include-templates custom/specific-template.yaml
```

</Note>


### List Template Path

`-tl` option in Nuclei is used to list the paths of templates, rather than executing them. This can help you inspect which templates would be used for scan given your current template filter.

```sh
# Command to list templates (-tl)
nuclei -tags cve -severity critical,high -author geeknik -tl
```

### Scan on internet database

Nuclei supports integration with [uncover module](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/uncover) that supports services like Shodan, Censys, Hunter, Zoomeye, many more to execute Nuclei on these databases.

Here are uncover options to use -

```console
nuclei -h uncover

UNCOVER:
   -uc, -uncover                  enable uncover engine
   -uq, -uncover-query string[]   uncover search query
   -ue, -uncover-engine string[]  uncover search engine (shodan,shodan-idb,fofa,censys,quake,hunter,zoomeye,netlas,criminalip) (default shodan)
   -uf, -uncover-field string     uncover fields to return (ip,port,host) (default "ip:port")
   -ul, -uncover-limit int        uncover results to return (default 100)
   -ucd, -uncover-delay int       delay between uncover query requests in seconds (0 to disable) (default 1)
```

You need to set the API key of the engine you are using as an environment variable in your shell.

```
export SHODAN_API_KEY=xxx
export CENSYS_API_ID=xxx
export CENSYS_API_SECRET=xxx
export FOFA_EMAIL=xxx
export FOFA_KEY=xxx
export QUAKE_TOKEN=xxx
export HUNTER_API_KEY=xxx
export ZOOMEYE_API_KEY=xxx
```

Required API keys can be obtained by signing up on following platform [Shodan](https://account.shodan.io/register), [Censys](https://censys.io/register), [Fofa](https://fofa.info/toLogin), [Quake](https://quake.360.net/quake/#/index), [Hunter](https://user.skyeye.qianxin.com/user/register?next=https%3A//hunter.qianxin.com/api/uLogin&fromLogin=1) and [ZoomEye](https://www.zoomeye.org/login) .

Example of template execution using a search query.

```
export SHODAN_API_KEY=xxx
nuclei -id 'CVE-2021-26855' -uq 'vuln:CVE-2021-26855' -ue shodan
```

It can also read queries from templates metadata and execute template against hosts returned by uncover for that query.

Example of template execution using template-defined search queries.

Template snippet of [CVE-2021-26855](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/cves/2021/CVE-2021-26855.yaml)

```yaml
metadata:
  shodan-query: 'vuln:CVE-2021-26855'
```

```console
nuclei -t cves/2021/CVE-2021-26855.yaml -uncover
nuclei -tags cve -uncover
```

We can update the nuclei configuration file to include these tags for all scans.

## Nuclei **Config**

> Since release of [v2.3.2](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/nuclei-v2-3-0-release/) nuclei uses [goflags](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/goflags) for clean CLI experience and long/short formatted flags.
>
> [goflags](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/goflags) comes with auto-generated config file support that coverts all available CLI flags into config file, basically you can define all CLI flags into config file to avoid repetitive CLI flags that loads as default for every scan of nuclei.
>
> Default path of nuclei config file is `$HOME/.config/nuclei/config.yaml`, uncomment and configure the flags you wish to run as default.

Here is an example config file:

```yaml
# Headers to include with all HTTP request
header:
  - 'X-BugBounty-Hacker: h1/geekboy'

# Directory based template execution
templates:
  - cves/
  - vulnerabilities/
  - misconfiguration/

# Tags based template execution
tags: exposures,cve

# Template Filters
tags: exposures,cve
author: geeknik,pikpikcu,dhiyaneshdk
severity: critical,high,medium

# Template Allowlist
# 
# Note: This will take precedence over the .nuclei-ignore file and denylist
# entries (exclude-tags or exclude-templates list).
include-tags: dos,fuzz # Tag based inclusion
include-templates: # Template based inclusion
  - vulnerabilities/xxx
  - misconfiguration/xxxx

# Template Denylist
exclude-tags: info # Tag based exclusion
exclude-templates: # Template based exclusion
  - vulnerabilities/xxx
  - misconfiguration/xxxx

# Rate Limit configuration
rate-limit: 500
bulk-size: 50
concurrency: 50
```

Once configured, **config file be used as default**, additionally custom config file can be also provided using `-config` flag.

<Note>
**Running nuclei with custom config file**

    ```
    nuclei -config project.yaml -list urls.txt
    ```

</Note>

## Nuclei Result Dashboard

Nuclei now allows seamless integration with the ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform to simplify the visualization of Nuclei results and generate swift reports. This highly requested feature from the community enables easier handling of scan results with minimal effort.

Follow the steps below to set up your PDCP Result Dashboard:

    1.  Visit https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io to create free PDCP API key.
    <img class="block" src="/images/pdcp-api-key.png" alt="PDCP API Key" />
    2.  Use the `nuclei -auth` command, enter your API key when prompted.
    3.  To perform a scan and upload the results straight to the cloud, use the `-cloud-upload` option while running a nuclei scan.

An example command might look like this:

```bash
nuclei -target http://honey.scanme.sh -cloud-upload
```

And the output would be like this:

```console
                     __     _

### Advanced Integration Options

**Setting API key via environment variable**

Avoid entering your API key via interactive prompt by setting it via environment variable.

```sh
export PDCP_API_KEY=XXXX-XXXX
```

**Enabling result upload by default**

If you want all your scans to automatically upload results to the cloud, enable the `ENABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD` environment variable.

```sh
export ENABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD=true
```

**Disabling cloud upload warnings**

To suppress warnings about result uploads, disable the `DISABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD_WRN` environment variable.

```sh
export DISABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD_WRN=true
```

Your configured PDCP API key stored in `$HOME/.pdcp/credentials.yaml`

<Warning>
Nuclei OSS results uploaded to the cloud platform are scheduled for automatic cleanup after 30 days, although this duration is subject to change as we gauge user feedback and requirement.
</Warning>

## Nuclei Reporting

Nuclei comes with reporting module support with the release of [v2.3.0](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/releases/nuclei-changelog/#nuclei-v230-10-march-2021) supporting GitHub, GitLab, and Jira integration, this allows nuclei engine to create automatic tickets on the supported platform based on found results.

| Platform    | GitHub | GitLab | Jira | Markdown | SARIF | Elasticsearch | Splunk HEC |
|-------------|:------:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:-----:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Support     |   ✔    |   ✔    |  ✔   |    ✔     |   ✔   |       ✔       |     ✔      |


`-rc, -report-config` flag can be used to provide a config file to read configuration details of the platform to integrate. Here is an [example config file](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/blob/main/cmd/nuclei/issue-tracker-config.yaml) for all supported platforms.

For example, to create tickets on GitHub, create a config file with the following content and replace the appropriate values:

```yaml
# GitHub contains configuration options for GitHub issue tracker

github:
  username: '$user'
  owner: '$user'
  token: '$token'
  project-name: 'testing-project'
  issue-label: 'Nuclei'
  duplicate-issue-check: true
```

Alternatively if you use GitLab, create a config file following content and replace the appropriate values:

```yaml
# GitLab contains configuration options for GitLab issue tracker

gitlab:
  username: '$user'
  base-url: 'gitlab.com'
  token: '$token'
  project-name: 'testing-project'
  issue-label: 'nuclei-label'
  severity-as-label: true
  duplicate-issue-check: true
```

To store results in Elasticsearch, create a config file with the following content and replace the appropriate values:

```yaml
# elasticsearch contains configuration options for elasticsearch exporter
elasticsearch:
  # IP for elasticsearch instance
  ip: 127.0.0.1
  # Port is the port of elasticsearch instance
  port: 9200
  # IndexName is the name of the elasticsearch index
  index-name: nuclei
```

To forward results to Splunk HEC, create a config file with the following content and replace the appropriate values:

```yaml
# splunkhec contains configuration options for splunkhec exporter
splunkhec:
  # Hostname for splunkhec instance
  host: '$hec_host'
  # Port is the port of splunkhec instance
  port: 8088
  # IndexName is the name of the splunkhec index
  index-name: nuclei
  # SSL enables ssl for splunkhec connection
  ssl: true
  # SSLVerification disables SSL verification for splunkhec
  ssl-verification: true
  # HEC Token for the splunkhec instance
  token: '$hec_token'
```

To forward results to Jira, create a config file with the following content and replace the appropriate values:

The Jira reporting options allows for custom fields, as well as using variables from the Nuclei templates in those custom fields.
The supported variables currently are: `$CVSSMetrics`, `$CVEID`, `$CWEID`, `$Host`, `$Severity`, `$CVSSScore`, `$Name`

In addition, Jira is strict when it comes to custom field entry. If the field is a dropdown, Jira accepts only the case sensitive specific string and the API call is slightly different. To support this, there are three types of customfields.

- `name` is the dropdown value
- `id` is the ID value of the dropdown
- `freeform` is if the customfield the entry of any value

To avoid duplication, the JQL query run can be slightly modified by the config file.
The `CLOSED_STATUS` can be changed in the Jira template file using the `status-not` variable.
`summary ~ TEMPLATE_NAME AND summary ~ HOSTNAME AND status != CLOSED_STATUS`

```yaml
jira:
  # cloud is the boolean which tells if Jira instance is running in the cloud or on-prem version is used
  cloud: true
  # update-existing is the boolean which tells if the existing, opened issue should be updated or new one should be created
  update-existing: false
  # URL is the jira application url
  url: https://localhost/jira
  # account-id is the account-id of the Jira user or username in case of on-prem Jira
  account-id: test-account-id
  # email is the email of the user for Jira instance
  email: test@test.com
  # token is the token for Jira instance or password in case of on-prem Jira
  token: test-token
  #project-name is the name of the project.
  project-name: test-project-name
  #issue-type is the name of the created issue type (case sensitive)
  issue-type: Bug
  # SeverityAsLabel (optional) sends the severity as the label of the created issue
  # User custom fields for Jira Cloud instead
  severity-as-label: true
  # Whatever your final status is that you want to use as a closed ticket - Closed, Done, Remediated, etc
  # When checking for duplicates, the JQL query will filter out status's that match this.
  # If it finds a match _and_ the ticket does have this status, a new one will be created.
  status-not: Closed
  # Customfield supports name, id and freeform. name and id are to be used when the custom field is a dropdown.
  # freeform can be used if the custom field is just a text entry
  # Variables can be used to pull various pieces of data from the finding itself.
  # Supported variables: $CVSSMetrics, $CVEID, $CWEID, $Host, $Severity, $CVSSScore, $Name
  custom_fields:
    customfield_00001:
      name: 'Nuclei'
    customfield_00002:
      freeform: $CVSSMetrics
    customfield_00003:
      freeform: $CVSSScore
```

**Running nuclei with reporting module:**

```bash
nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -rc issue-tracker.yaml
```

Similarly, other platforms can be configured. Reporting module also supports basic filtering and duplicate checks to avoid duplicate ticket creation.

```yaml
allow-list:
  severity: high,critical
```

This will ensure to only creating tickets for issues identified with **high** and **critical** severity; similarly, `deny-list` can be used to exclude issues with a specific severity.

If you are running periodic scans on the same assets, you might want to consider `-rdb, -report-db` flag that creates a local copy of the valid findings in the given directory utilized by reporting module to compare and **create tickets for unique issues only**.

```bash
nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -rc issue-tracker.yaml -rdb prod
```

**<ins>Markdown Export</ins>**

Nuclei supports markdown export of valid findings with `-me, -markdown-export` flag, this flag takes directory as input to store markdown formatted reports.

Including request/response in the markdown report is optional, and included when `-irr, -include-rr` flag is used along with `-me`.

```bash
nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -irr -markdown-export reports
```

**<ins>SARIF Export</ins>**

Nuclei supports SARIF export of valid findings with `-se, -sarif-export` flag. This flag takes a file as input to store SARIF formatted report.

```bash
nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -sarif-export report.sarif
```

It is also possible to visualize Nuclei results using **SARIF** files.

1. By uploading a SARIF file to [SARIF Viewer](https://microsoft.github.io/sarif-web-component/)

2. By uploading a SARIF file to [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github)

More info on the SARIF output is documented [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/pull/2925).

<Note>
  These are **not official** viewers of Nuclei and `Nuclei` has no liability
  towards any of these options to visualize **Nuclei** results. These are just
  some publicly available options to visualize SARIF files.
</Note>

## Scan **Metrics**

Nuclei expose running scan metrics on a local port `9092` when `-metrics` flag is used and can be accessed at **localhost:9092/metrics**, default port to expose scan information is configurable using `-metrics-port` flag.

Here is an example to query `metrics` while running nuclei as following `nuclei -t cves/ -l urls.txt -metrics`

```bash
curl -s localhost:9092/metrics | jq .
```

```json
{
  "duration": "0:00:03",
  "errors": "2",
  "hosts": "1",
  "matched": "0",
  "percent": "99",
  "requests": "350",
  "rps": "132",
  "startedAt": "2021-03-27T18:02:18.886745+05:30",
  "templates": "256",
  "total": "352"
}
```

## Passive Scan

Nuclei engine supports passive mode scanning for HTTP based template utilizing file support, with this support we can run HTTP based templates against locally stored HTTP response data collected from any other tool.

```sh
nuclei -passive -target http_data
```

<Note>Passive mode support is limited for templates having `{{BasedURL}}` or `{{BasedURL/}}` as base path.</Note>

## Running With Docker
If Nuclei was installed within a Docker container based on the [installation instructions](./install),
the executable does not have the context of the host machine. This means that the executable will not be able to access
local files such as those used for input lists or templates. To resolve this, the container should be run with volumes
mapped to the local filesystem to allow access to these files.

### Basic Usage
This example runs a Nuclei container against `google.com`, prints the results to JSON and removes the container once it
has completed:
```sh
docker run --rm projectdiscovery/nuclei -u google.com -jsonl
```

### Using Volumes
This example runs a Nuclei container against a list of URLs, writes the results to a `.jsonl` file and removes the
container once it has completed.
```sh
# This assumes there's a file called `urls.txt` in the current directory
docker run --rm -v ./:/app/ projectdiscovery/nuclei -l /app/urls.txt -jsonl /app/results.jsonl
# The results will be written to `./results.jsonl` on the host machine once the container has completed
```
