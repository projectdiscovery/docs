## Basic Usage

The command `interact-client` generates a unique payload that can be used for Out-Of-Band (OOB) testing with minimal interactin in the output.

```console
interactsh-client

    _       __                       __       __  
   (_)___  / /____  _________ ______/ /______/ /_ 
  / / __ \/ __/ _ \/ ___/ __ '/ ___/ __/ ___/ __ \
 / / / / / /_/  __/ /  / /_/ / /__/ /_(__  ) / / /
/_/_/ /_/\__/\___/_/   \__,_/\___/\__/____/_/ /_/ v0.0.5

```

## Session File

`interactsh-client` with `-sf, -session-file` flag can be used to store/read the current session information from user defined file. This functionality is useful to resume the same session to poll the interactions even after the client gets stopped or closed. 

```console
interactsh-client -sf interact.session

    _       __                       __       __  
   (_)___  / /____  _________ ______/ /______/ /_

## Verbose Mode

Running the `interactsh-client` in **verbose mode** (v) allows you to to see the whole request and response, along with an output file to analyze afterwards.

```console
interactsh-client -v -o interactsh-logs.txt

    _       __                       __       __  
   (_)___  / /____  _________ ______/ /______/ /_

## Choosing a Server
When running `interactsh-client`, it is required that it can connect to a running `interactsh-server`. The Interactsh server captures and logs out-of-band interactions, while the client generates testing URLs and analyzes these interactions for vulnerabilities.

You can either use one of ProjectDiscovery's default interactsh servers or choose you run a self-hosted sever.

### ProjectDiscovery interachsh servers

We maintain a list of default Interactsh servers to use with `interactsh-client`:

- oast.pro
- oast.live
- oast.site
- oast.online
- oast.fun
- oast.me

Default servers are subject to change/rotate/down at any time, thus we recommend using a self-hosted interactsh server if you are experiencing issues with the default server.

### Self-Hosted interactsh Server

Using the `server` flag, `interactsh-client` can be configured to connect with a self-hosted Interactsh server, this flag accepts single or multiple server separated by comma.

```sh
interactsh-client -server hackwithautomation.com
```

**Using a Protected Self-Hosted Server**

Using the `token` flag, `interactsh-client` can connect to a self-hosted Interactsh server that is protected with authentication.

```sh
interactsh-client -server hackwithautomation.com -token XXX
```

## Using with Notify

If you are away from your terminal, you may use [notify](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/notify) to send a real-time interaction notification to any supported platform.

```sh
interactsh-client | notify
```

## Interactsh Web Client

[Interactsh-web](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh-web) is a free and open-source web client that displays Interactsh interactions in a well-managed dashboard in your browser. It uses the browser's local storage to store and display all incoming interactions. By default, the web client is configured to use **interact.sh** as default interactsh server, and supports other self-hosted public/authencaited interactsh servers as well.

A hosted instance of **interactsh-web** client is available at https://app.interactsh.com

## Interactsh Docker Client

A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectdiscovery/interactsh-client) is also provided with interactsh client that is ready to run and can be used in the following way:

```sh
docker run projectdiscovery/interactsh-client:latest
```

```console
docker run projectdiscovery/interactsh-client:latest

    _       __                       __       __

## Integrations

### Burp Suite Extension
See [integrations](/tools/interactsh/integrations) for more details on the [interactsh-collaborator](https://github.com/wdahlenburg/interactsh-collaborator).

### ZAP Add-On
See [integrations](/tools/interactsh/integrations) for more details on using interactsh with ZAP.

### Use as library

The [examples](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/tree/main/examples) show using the interactsh client library to get external interactions for a generated URL by making a http request to the URL.

### Nuclei - OAST

[Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) vulnerability scanner utilize **Interactsh** for automated payload generation and detection of out of band based security vulnerabilities.

See [Nuclei + Interactsh](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/nuclei-interactsh-integration/) Integration blog and [guide document](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/reference/oob-testing) for more information.

## Cloud Metadata

Interactsh server supports DNS records for cloud metadata services, which is useful for testing SSRF-related vulnerabilities.

Currently supported metadata services:

- [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
- [Alibaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-ecs-metadata-user-data-and-dynamic-data_594351)

Example:

* **aws.interact.sh** points to 169.254.169.254
* **alibaba.interact.sh** points to 100.100.100.200
