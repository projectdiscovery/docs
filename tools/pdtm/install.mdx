## Installation Notes
  - PDTM requires the latest version of [**Go**](https://go.dev/doc/install)
  - Projects are installed by downloading the released project binary. This means that projects can only be installed on the platforms for which binaries have been published.
  - The path \$HOME/.pdtm/go/bin is added to the \$PATH variable by default
