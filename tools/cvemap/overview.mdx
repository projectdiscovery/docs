## What is **cvemap?**
cvemap is a tool that provides a structured and easily navigable way to explore CVEs from the command line. 
ProjectDiscovery's cvemap combines data from multiple public sources including:

 - CISA database of CVEs and Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs)
 - Data from HackerOne's CVE Discovery about the most frequently reported CVEs in their system
 - Data about EPSS scoring and the mapping to Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
 - Data about public PoCs that might be available on GitHub along with the status of any Nuclei Template for fingerprinting the CVE
