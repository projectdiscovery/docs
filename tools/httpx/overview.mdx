## What is **httpx?**

httpx is a fast and multi-purpose HTTP toolkit built to support running multiple probes using a public library. 
Probes are specific tests or checks to gather information about web servers, URLs, or other HTTP elements. 
Httpx is designed to maintain result reliability with an increased number of threads.

Typically, users employ httpx to efficiently identify and analyze web server configurations, verify HTTP responses, and diagnose potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. 
It can also be in a pipeline that transitions from asset identification to technology enrichment and then feeds into detection of vulnerabilities.

## Features and capabilities
