<Warning>
**DEPRECATED:** This endpoint is deprecated in favor of the consolidated `/v1/leaks` endpoint.

Use `GET /v1/leaks?type=customer` instead for the same functionality with enhanced features.
</Warning>

## Migration Guide

This endpoint has been replaced by the new consolidated leaks API. Here's how to migrate:

### Old Way (Deprecated)
```bash
GET /v1/leaks/domain/customers?search=example&limit=20
```

### New Way (Recommended)
```bash
GET /v1/leaks?type=customer&search=example&limit=20
```

## Why Migrate?

The new consolidated endpoint offers several advantages:

- **Unified API**: Access all leak types (personal, employee, customer) from one endpoint
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Better privacy controls for customer data
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated filtering and search capabilities
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized for better response times
- **Future-Proof**: All new features will be added to the consolidated endpoint
- **Better Analytics**: Enhanced grouping and summary capabilities

## Privacy Enhancements

The new consolidated endpoint includes enhanced privacy protections for customer leaks:

- **Password Masking**: Customer leak passwords are never unmasked (privacy protection)
- **Access Control**: Stricter validation of domain ownership
- **Audit Logging**: Better tracking of access to customer data
