## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring
- Check domain stats regularly to identify new leaks quickly
- Set up automated alerts when leak counts increase
- Monitor the ratio of open vs fixed leaks

### Performance Considerations
- Cache stats data appropriately to avoid excessive API calls
- Use this endpoint for summary data, detailed leak info requires other endpoints
- Consider rate limiting when building automated monitoring systems
