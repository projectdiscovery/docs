## Overview

Retrieve detailed information for a specific leak by its ID. This endpoint provides access to complete leak details with optional password and email unmasking based on your permissions and domain verification.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Access Control
- **Personal leaks**: Always accessible if the leak belongs to your email
- **Employee/Customer leaks**: Requires domain verification for the associated domain
- **Password unmasking**: Requires domain verification
- **Customer leak privacy**: Passwords are never unmasked for customer leaks (privacy protection)

### Leak ID Format
The leak ID must be a 32-character MD5 hash (e.g., `b3652f2555841f7652badd9804859f4e`).

## Request Body

```json
{
  "leakid": "b3652f2555841f7652badd9804859f4e"

## Data Fields Explained

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique 32-character MD5 hash identifier |
| `url` | The website/service where credentials were compromised |
| `username` | Username or email address (always unmasked if authorized) |
| `password` | Password (masked/unmasked based on permissions) |
| `device_ip` | IP address of the compromised device |
| `hostname` | Computer/device hostname |
| `os` | Operating system information |
| `malware_path` | File path of the malware that captured the credentials |
| `country` | Geographic location of the compromise |
| `log_date` | When the credentials were captured |
| `hardware_id` | Unique hardware identifier |
| `domain` | Domain associated with this leak (for filtering) |
| `email_domain` | Domain extracted from the email address |
| `fetched_at` | When this leak was discovered/indexed |
| `status` | Current status (`open` or `fixed`) |

## Password Unmasking Rules

### When Passwords Are Unmasked
- Personal leaks: Always unmasked for the account owner
- Employee leaks: Unmasked with domain verification
- Customer leaks: **Never unmasked** (privacy protection)

### When Passwords Are Masked
- Shows as `***MASKED***` when access is not authorized
- Customer leak passwords are always masked for privacy protection

## Usage Examples

### Get leak information
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.projectdiscovery.io/v1/leaks/info" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "leakid": "b3652f2555841f7652badd9804859f4e"
  }'
```

## Security Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- Customer leak passwords are never exposed to maintain customer privacy
- Access is strictly controlled based on domain verification
- All access attempts are logged for security auditing

### Data Sensitivity
- Leak information contains sensitive credential data
- Ensure secure handling and storage of retrieved information
- Consider implementing additional encryption for stored leak details

### Rate Limiting
- This endpoint may have rate limits to prevent abuse
- Implement proper error handling for rate limit responses
