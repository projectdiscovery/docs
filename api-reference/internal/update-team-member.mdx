openapi: patch /v1/user/team/member
---

Update an existing team member's role and permissions. This endpoint allows you to modify member access levels without removing and re-adding them, preserving their history and activity within the team.

<Note>
  You must have Admin or Owner permissions to update team member roles. Owners can update any member; Admins cannot update Owner roles.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Cannot Modify Owner Role:** The team owner cannot be changed through this endpoint. To transfer ownership, contact support or use the dedicated ownership transfer process.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Downgrading Permissions:** When downgrading a member's role (e.g., Admin to Member), they will immediately lose access to administrative functions. Ensure this doesn't disrupt ongoing operations.
</Warning>
