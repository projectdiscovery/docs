openapi: patch /v1/user/team/member
---

Update an existing team member's role and permissions. This endpoint allows you to modify member access levels without removing and re-adding them, preserving their history and activity within the team.

## Use Cases

- **Role Adjustments**: Promote or adjust member permissions based on changing responsibilities
- **Access Control**: Modify permissions in response to organizational changes
- **Privilege Management**: Implement principle of least privilege by adjusting roles over time
- **Temporary Elevation**: Grant temporary elevated access for specific projects
- **Compliance**: Adjust access levels to meet security policy requirements

## What You Can Update

- **Role Change**: Modify member's role (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- **Permission Adjustments**: Update specific permissions within a role
- **Status Changes**: Activate, suspend, or reactivate member access

<Note>
  You must have Admin or Owner permissions to update team member roles. Owners can update any member; Admins cannot update Owner roles.
</Note>

## Role Transition Examples

**Promoting to Admin:**
```
Member → Admin
```
- User was a regular member who now leads the security team
- Gains access to team settings and member management
- Can now configure integrations and manage workflows

**Restricting to Viewer:**
```
Member → Viewer
```
- User moved to a reporting or oversight role
- Maintains visibility but can no longer create scans
- Ideal for stakeholders who need read-only access

**Temporary Elevation:**
```
Viewer → Member (temporarily)
Member → Viewer (after project)
```
- Grant temporary access for specific projects
- Return to previous role when no longer needed

<Warning>
  **Cannot Modify Owner Role:** The team owner cannot be changed through this endpoint. To transfer ownership, contact support or use the dedicated ownership transfer process.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Downgrading Permissions:** When downgrading a member's role (e.g., Admin to Member), they will immediately lose access to administrative functions. Ensure this doesn't disrupt ongoing operations.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Document Changes**: Maintain an audit log of role changes with justification
2. **Communication**: Notify members when their role changes, especially for downgrades
3. **Review Regularly**: Conduct periodic access reviews to ensure roles are appropriate
4. **Gradual Changes**: When possible, make incremental permission changes rather than dramatic shifts
5. **Test Impact**: Understand what access is gained or lost before making changes
