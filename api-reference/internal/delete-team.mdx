openapi: delete /v1/user/team
---

Permanently delete a team workspace from ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform. This is a destructive operation that removes all team data, including scans, assets, vulnerabilities, and configurations.

## ⚠️ Critical Information

<Warning>
  **This operation is irreversible!** Once a team is deleted, all associated data including scans, assets, vulnerabilities, templates, and configurations will be permanently removed and cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before deleting a team, you must:

1. **Remove all team members**: The team must have **zero members** (only the owner remains)
2. **Owner permissions**: Only the team owner can delete a team
3. **Confirmation**: Understand that all team data will be lost permanently

## Use Cases

- **Workspace Cleanup**: Remove unused or test workspaces
- **Organization Restructuring**: Delete deprecated teams during reorganization
- **Compliance**: Remove teams as part of data retention policies
- **Resource Management**: Clean up temporary or project-specific workspaces

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a team, the following data is permanently removed:
- All vulnerability scans and results
- All discovered assets and enumeration data
- All custom templates and configurations
- All team settings and preferences
- All scan histories and logs
- All team-specific integrations

## Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export Important Data">
    Before deletion, export any scans, reports, or data you need to retain using the export endpoints.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove Team Members">
    Delete or reassign all team members. The team must have 0 members before it can be deleted.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Prerequisites">
    Confirm you're the team owner and that all members have been removed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete Team">
    Call this endpoint with the team ID to permanently delete the workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If you need to preserve any team data, make sure to export it before deletion. There is no way to recover deleted team data.
</Note>

## Alternative Options

Consider these alternatives before deleting:
- **Archive Instead**: Keep the team but remove active members
- **Transfer Ownership**: Assign the team to another user
- **Export Data**: Back up important scans and configurations before deletion
