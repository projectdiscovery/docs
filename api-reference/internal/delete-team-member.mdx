openapi: delete /v1/user/team/member
---

Remove a member from your team workspace, revoking their access to all team resources including scans, assets, vulnerabilities, and configurations. This endpoint immediately terminates the member's access to the team.

## Use Cases

- **Employee Offboarding**: Remove access when team members leave the organization
- **Access Revocation**: Immediately remove unauthorized or compromised accounts
- **Project Completion**: Remove temporary members after project-specific work concludes
- **Security Incidents**: Quickly revoke access during security investigations
- **Team Restructuring**: Remove members during organizational changes

## What Happens When You Delete a Member

**Immediate Effects:**
- ✅ Member loses all access to team workspace
- ✅ Cannot view scans, assets, or vulnerabilities
- ✅ Cannot create or modify team resources
- ✅ Removed from team member list
- ✅ Cannot access team API keys or integrations

**What is Preserved:**
- 📝 Audit logs showing member's historical actions
- 📝 Scans and assets they created remain in the team
- 📝 Their user account (outside the team) remains active

<Note>
  The member's email must be provided to identify who should be removed. You cannot remove the team owner through this endpoint.
</Note>

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
  **Immediate Access Revocation:** This action takes effect immediately. The member will lose access to all team resources without warning. Consider communicating with the member before removal if appropriate.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Cannot Remove Owner:** The team owner cannot be removed through this endpoint. To change team ownership, you must transfer ownership first, then the previous owner can be removed.
</Warning>

## Recommended Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Member Activity">
    Check the member's recent activity and ensure no critical operations are in progress
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Backup/Transfer Ownership">
    If the member owns critical resources, transfer or document them before removal
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Communicate (If Appropriate)">
    For planned removals, inform the member beforehand to allow proper handoff
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove Member">
    Call this endpoint with the member's email address
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Removal">
    Confirm the member no longer appears in the team member list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Audit & Document">
    Log the removal for compliance and future reference
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Scenarios

**Scenario: Employee Resignation**
- **Timing**: Remove on last day of employment
- **Actions**: 
  - Transfer ownership of critical scans/assets
  - Document their work for team continuity
  - Remove access at end of business day

**Scenario: Compromised Account**
- **Timing**: Immediate removal
- **Actions**:
  - Remove access immediately
  - Review their recent activity
  - Rotate any API keys they had access to
  - Investigate potential security impact

**Scenario: Contractor Project End**
- **Timing**: After project delivery and sign-off
- **Actions**:
  - Export any needed reports
  - Document findings they discovered
  - Remove access after final deliverables

## Best Practices

1. **Timely Removal**: Remove access promptly when no longer needed
2. **Documentation**: Maintain records of who was removed and why
3. **Transfer First**: Ensure critical work is transferred before removal
4. **Audit Trail**: Review member's activity before removal for compliance
5. **Communication**: When appropriate, inform the member of pending removal
6. **Verify**: Confirm removal was successful and access is revoked

## Re-Adding Members

If you need to re-add a member after removal:
- They must be invited again using the "Add Team Member" endpoint
- They will need to accept a new invitation
- Their previous role and permissions are not automatically restored
- Consider their historical context when assigning new role

<Tip>
  Instead of removing and re-adding members, consider temporarily changing their role to "Viewer" if they might need access again in the future.
</Tip>

## Alternative Options

Before removing a member, consider:
- **Role Downgrade**: Change them to Viewer for read-only access
- **Temporary Suspension**: Some systems support suspending instead of deleting
- **Transfer Ownership**: If they own critical resources, transfer first
- **Export Data**: Backup any member-specific configurations or work
