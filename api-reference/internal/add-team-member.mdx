## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign the minimum role necessary for the user's responsibilities
2. **Verification**: Double-check email addresses before sending invitations
3. **Role Review**: Periodically audit member roles and adjust as responsibilities change
4. **Onboarding Documentation**: Provide new members with documentation about your team's scanning policies
5. **Monitor Pending**: Track invitation acceptance and follow up on pending invites
