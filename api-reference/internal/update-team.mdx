openapi: patch /v1/user/team
---

Update an existing team's metadata, including team name, description, and settings. This endpoint allows you to modify team configurations without affecting team members or their access permissions.

## Use Cases

- **Rebranding**: Update team names to reflect organizational changes
- **Configuration Management**: Adjust team settings and preferences programmatically
- **Metadata Updates**: Keep team descriptions and information current
- **Settings Optimization**: Fine-tune team configurations based on usage patterns

## What You Can Update

The following team properties can be modified:
- Team name
- Team description
- Team settings and preferences
- Notification configurations
- Default scanning parameters

## Important Considerations

<Note>
  You must be the team owner or have admin permissions to update team information. The `X-Team-Id` header must match the team you're authorized to modify.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Changing certain team settings may affect ongoing scans, scheduled tasks, or team member workflows. Consider notifying team members before making significant changes.
</Warning>

## What This Endpoint Does NOT Do

- **Does not** modify team members or their roles (use team member endpoints for that)
- **Does not** affect team subscription or billing
- **Does not** change team ownership
- **Does not** impact existing scans, assets, or vulnerabilities

## Best Practices

1. **Incremental Updates**: Make targeted changes rather than updating everything at once
2. **Validation**: Verify the update was successful by retrieving team info afterward
3. **Audit Trail**: Log team updates for compliance and troubleshooting
4. **Communication**: Notify team members of significant configuration changes
