Update an existing team's metadata, including team name, description, and settings. This endpoint allows you to modify team configurations without affecting team members or their access permissions.

## What You Can Update

The following team properties can be modified:
- Team name
- Team description
- Team settings and preferences
- Notification configurations
- Default scanning parameters

## Important Considerations

<Note>
  You must be the team owner or have admin permissions to update team information. The `X-Team-Id` header must match the team you're authorized to modify.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Changing certain team settings may affect ongoing scans, scheduled tasks, or team member workflows. Consider notifying team members before making significant changes.
