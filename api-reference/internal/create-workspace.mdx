Create a new team workspace in ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform. This endpoint allows you to programmatically create team workspaces for collaborative security testing and vulnerability management.

## Required Information

To create a workspace, you need to provide:
- **Team Name**: A unique, descriptive name for the workspace
- **Team Description** (optional): Additional context about the team's purpose
- **Initial Settings**: Default configurations for the new workspace

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  Creating a team workspace is a significant operation. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the team name is unique within your organization.
</Warning>

<Note>
  After successful creation, you'll receive a `team_id` that should be used for all subsequent team-related operations. Store this ID securely in your application.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive team names that reflect their purpose (e.g., "Security-Team-Production", "Client-ABC-Testing")
2. **Documentation**: Maintain a record of created workspaces and their purposes
3. **Access Control**: Immediately configure appropriate access controls after workspace creation
4. **Cleanup**: Implement processes to remove unused workspaces to avoid clutter
