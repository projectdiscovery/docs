## Overview 

The ProjectDiscovery API v1 is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has resource-oriented URLs, accepts and returns JSON in most cases, and the API uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. Our API also conforms to the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/).

This API documentation will walk you through each of the available resources, and provides code examples for `cURL`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, `Go` and `Java`. Each endpoint includes the required authorization information and parameters, and provides examples of the response you should expect.

## Authentication

The ProjectDiscovery API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API key in ProjectDiscovery at https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/ under your user information.

Authentication with the API is performed using a custom request header - `X-Api-Key` - which should simply be the value of your API key found with your ProjectDiscovery account.

You must make all API calls over `HTTPS`. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail, as will requests without authentication or without all required parameters.

## Resources
Below (and in the menu on the left) you can find the various resources available to the ProjectDiscovery API.
