## Installations

### Install Go

ProjectDiscovery runs on any OS that supports Go.

<Tip>This example uses Linux, but [this blog post](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/getting-started-with-projectdiscovery-in-linux-and-windows/) provides instructions for other OSs. You can also refer to [Go's installation guide](https://go.dev/doc/install).</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the latest version">
  Download and install [the latest version of Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).
  </Step> 
  <Step title="Verify the version">
  Run `go version` to confirm installation (_v 1.21 at the time of writing_)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Update your `$PATH`

The `$PATH` variable defines directories with executable programs. You need to add the `go/bin` directory (where ProjectDiscovery binaries reside) to `$PATH` manually.

<Note>This folder is not automatically added to your `$PATH`. Refer to the steps below to update it manually.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your GOPATH">
    Run `go env | grep GOPATH` and copy the output path. Append `/bin` to it if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your shell config file">
      Edit your shell config (e.g., `nano ~/.zshrc` for zsh or `nano ~/.bashrc` for bash). Add `export PATH="$PATH:/your/go/path/bin"` at the end.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset your terminal">
      Run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`, or restart your terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your updated PATH">
      Run `echo $PATH` to confirm the Go binary directory is included.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Install Nuclei

<Info>A quick overview of Nuclei and its templates before installation.</Info>

**What is Nuclei?**

> Nuclei is a community-powered vulnerability scanner that uses templates to identify vulnerabilities in your assets.
As an open-source tool, it has the benefit of a huge community of users and contributors who have helped to create a vast library of templates. 

Templates, are YAML files used to define what is scanned by Nuclei. The template library includes many options and customizations, and supports any templates you create to meet your requirements.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Nuclei with Go">
      Run `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest` in your terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm installation">
      Run `nuclei -h` to see available options and flags.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sample Nuclei Output

```java
user@Sample ~ % nuclei -h

   -l, -list string           path to file containing a list of target URLs/hosts to scan (one per line)
   -resume string             resume scan using resume.cfg (clustering will be disabled)
   -sa, -scan-all-ips         scan all the IP's associated with DNS record
   -iv, -ip-version string[]  IP version to scan of hostname (4,6) - (default 4)

TEMPLATES:
   -nt, -new-templates                    run only new templates added in latest nuclei-templates release
   -ntv, -new-templates-version string[]  run new templates added in specific version
   -as, -automatic-scan                   automatic web scan using wappalyzer technology detection to tags mapping
   -t, -templates string[]                list of template or template directory to run (comma-separated, file)
   -tu, -template-url string[]            list of template urls to run (comma-separated, file)
   -w, -workflows string[]                list of workflow or workflow directory to run (comma-separated, file)
   -wu, -workflow-url string[]            list of workflow urls to run (comma-separated, file)
   -validate                              validate the passed templates to nuclei
   -nss, -no-strict-syntax                disable strict syntax check on templates
   -td, -template-display                 displays the templates content
   -tl                                    list all available templates
   ```

## Run a Scan

Let's run a scan against a test host to showcase Nucleiâ€™s behavior.

> We'll be using the test URL(`http://honey.scanme.sh/`) to demonstrate the expected scan behavior and walk you through some results.

### Scan your host
Run `nuclei -u http://honey.scanme.sh/` to scan the target host with all available templates.

_The -u option specifies the target you want to scan with all available templates._ 

### View results
Here we have an example (edited for easier readability) 

```java
user@Test-MBP ~ %  nuclei -u http://scanme.sh

### Understanding your results

If you examine the following line of output

`[mismatched-ssl-certificate] [ssl] [low] scanme.sh:443 [CN: scanme]`

The fields are as follows:
 - `[mismatched-ssl-certificate]` is the template-id for the finding
 - `[ssl]` is the protocol associated with the finding
 - `[low]` is the severity associated with the finding
 - `Scanme.sh:443` is the output (in this case the host that the finding applies to)
 - `[CN: scanme]` - This output also includes an [extracted value](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/reference/extractors), which is not typically in all templates but does show an example of some of the other types of output you might see. 


So, each line of output follows this structure:
`[template-id]` `[protocol]` `[severity]` `output (impacted host, etc)`
