## Installations

### Install Go

ProjectDiscovery runs on any operating system that supports Go, but this example uses Linux. 

For instructions on installing Go for an OS besides Linux [check out this post our blog](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/getting-started-with-projectdiscovery-in-linux-and-windows/) 
or refer to the installation instructions [available through the Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Download and install [the latest version of Go](https://go.dev/doc/install). 

### Update your $PATH

PATH is an environment variable on UNIX systems to define which directories contain executable programs. 
The variable is set within the config file for your particular shell.

To run Nuclei the folder where it resides needs to be in the PATH. ProjectDiscovery binaries are stored in the go/bin directory which is usually in the home directory. 
_This folder is not automatically added to your PATH. Refer to the steps below to update it manually._

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your GOPATH">
    To verify your GOPATH Run `go env | grep GOPATH` in your terminal and copy the output path. 
    You may need to add a `/bin` to the end of this path in order for it to work correctly. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your shell config file">
    open the shell config file for your shell in the editor of your choice (this example refers to nano). This command is `nano ~/.zshrc` for zsh or `nano ~/.bashrc` for bash. 
    At the bottom of the file, add `export PATH=”$PATH:insert/go/path/here/bin”`, replacing `insert/go/path/here` with the GOPATH you found earlier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset your terminal">
    Finally, run `source /.zshrc` or `source /.bashrc` to reset your terminal and reload it with the new config added. 
    You can also just close your terminal and open it again for this to take effect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your updated PATH">
    Your PATH should be updated. 
    Type `$PATH` to check that the go binary directory is added to the end.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Install Nuclei

Before we jump into the installation here's a super high-level overview of Nuclei, templates, and what this tool is all about!

Nuclei is a community-powered vulnerability scanner that uses templates to identify vulnerabilities in your assets. 
As an open-source tool, it has the benefit of a huge community of users and contributors who have helped to create a vast library of templates. 

Templates, are YAML files used to define what is scanned by Nuclei. The template library has a ton of options and customizations, and supports any templates you create to meet your requirements.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Nuclei with Go">
    From your terminal run the following command `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm installation">
    To confirm installation, on your terminal  run `nuclei -h` to see the list of options and flags available.
  </Step>
</Steps>

   -tl                                    list all available templates
   ```

## Run a Scan

Typically, to run a scan you need to have assets identified (that you have permission to scan). 
In our example we're going to run our scan with a testing host that we use to detect weak template matchers with sample vulnerabilities and sample results. 

We'll be using the test URL(`http://honey.scanme.sh/`) in our example to demonstrate the expected behavior and walk you through some results. 

### Scan your host
To scan your target host, on your terminal, run `nuclei -u http://honey.scanme.sh/`. 
_The -u option specifies the target you want to scan with all available templates._ 

### View results
Here we have an example (edited for easier readability) 

```java
user@Test-MBP ~ %  nuclei -u http://scanme.sh

### Understanding your results

If you examine the following line of output

`[mismatched-ssl-certificate] [ssl] [low] scanme.sh:443 [CN: scanme]`

The fields are as follows:
 - `[mismatched-ssl-certificate]` is the template-id for the finding
 - `[ssl]` is the protocol associated with the finding
 - `[low]` is the severity associated with the finding
 - `Scanme.sh:443` is the output (in this case the host that the finding applies to)
 - `[CN: scanme]` - This output also includes an [extracted value](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/reference/extractors), which is not typically in all templates but does show an example of some of the other types of output you might see. 


So, for each line of output from our scan the data format is as follows:
`[template-id]` `[protocol]` `[severity]` `output (impacted host, etc)`
